    "full_text": "Calquence plus venetoclax approved in the US as first all-oral, fixed-duration combination for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in the 1st-line setting\nPUBLISHED\n20 February 2026\nCalquence plus venetoclax demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival vs. chemoimmunotherapy, with 77% of patients progression free at three years\u00a0in AMPLIFY Phase III trial\nAstraZeneca\u2019s Calquence (acalabrutinib) in combination with venetoclax has been approved in the US as the first all-oral, fixed-duration regimen for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).\nThe approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was based on positive results from the\nAMPLIFY\nPhase III trial, which were presented at the American Society of Hematology 2024 Annual Meeting and published in\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\n.\n1,2\nCLL is the most common type of leukaemia in adults.\n3\nAn estimated 18,500 people were treated for CLL in the 1st-line setting in the US in 2024.\n4\nJennifer Brown, MD, PhD, Director of the CLL Center of the Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the Worthington and Margaret Collette Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and principal investigator of the AMPLIFY trial, said: \u201cThe continuous regimens frequently used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukaemia often come with side effects that may become burdensome to patients over time. The US approval of the Calquence combination offers patients an all-oral, 14-month, fixed-duration treatment option that is highly effective and well-tolerated, and gives physicians greater flexibility to tailor treatment plans for individual patient needs and goals.\u201d\nDave Fredrickson, Executive Vice President, Oncology Haematology Business Unit, AstraZeneca, said: \u201cToday\u2019s approval delivers the first all-oral, fixed-duration BTK inhibitor-based regimen in the US for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. This Calquence combination has the potential to meaningfully change 1st-line chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treatment decisions and underscores our commitment to improving on the current standard of care for people living with blood cancers.\u201d\nGwen Nichols, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Blood Cancer United, formerly The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, said: \u201cManaging\u00a0an\u00a0incurable\u00a0blood cancer\u00a0that progresses slowly\u00a0can often feel indefinite and overwhelming. We welcome new treatment options that may ease the burden, restore a sense of control and offer renewed hope for those navigating life with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.\u201d\nResults from the AMPLIFY Phase III trial showed 77% of patients treated with Calquence plus venetoclax were progression free at three years, versus 67% of patients treated with standard-of-care chemotherapy (investigator\u2019s choice of fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab or bendamustine-rituximab).\n2\nMedian progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached versus 47.6 months for chemoimmunotherapy.\n2\nFurther, Calquence plus venetoclax reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 35% compared to chemoimmunotherapy (based on hazard ratio 0.65; 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.87; p=0.0038).\n2\nCalquence plus venetoclax is\napproved\nin the European Union, Canada, UK and several other countries, and regulatory applications for the regimen based on the AMPLIFY results are currently under review in additional countries.\nThe safety and tolerability of\u00a0Calquence\u00a0was consistent with its known safety profile, and no new safety signals were identified.\nNotes\nChronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)\nCLL is the most prevalent type of leukaemia in adults, with an estimated 40,000 people being treated for CLL in the first line in the US, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan and China in 2024.\n4\nAlthough some people with CLL may not experience any symptoms at diagnosis, others may experience symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue, weight loss, chills, fever, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes and abdominal pain.\n5\nIn CLL, there is an accumulation of abnormal lymphocytes within the blood, bone marrow and lymph nodes. As the number of abnormal cells increases, there is less room within the marrow for the production of normal white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.\n3\nThis could result in infection, anaemia and bleeding. B-cell receptor signalling through BTK is one of the essential growth pathways for CLL.\nAMPLIFY\nAMPLIFY is a randomised, global, multi-centre, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Calquence in combination with venetoclax, with or without obinutuzumab, compared to investigator's choice of chemoimmunotherapy (fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab or bendamustine-rituximab) in adult patients with previously untreated CLL without del(17p) or TP53 mutation.\n6\nPatients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive either Calquence plus venetoclax, or Calquence plus venetoclax with obinutuzumab for a fixed duration, or standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy.\n6\nBoth the Calquence containing arms were administered for a fixed duration of 14 cycles (each 28 days), and the standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy was administered for 6 cycles.\n6\nThe primary endpoint is PFS in the Calquence and venetoclax arm as assessed by an Independent Review Committee, and PFS is a key secondary endpoint in the Calquence plus venetoclax with obinutuzumab arm.\n7\nOther key secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and undetectable measurable residual disease.\n6\nThe trial includes 27 countries across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania.\n6\nThe AMPLIFY trial enrolled patients from 2019 to 2021, continuing through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n6\nCalquence\nCalquence\u00a0(acalabrutinib) is a second-generation, selective inhibitor of Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK).\u00a0Calquence\u00a0binds covalently to BTK, thereby inhibiting its activity.\n7\nIn B-cells, BTK signalling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis and adhesion.\nCalquence is approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in the US, Japan and China, and approved for CLL in Europe and many other countries. Calquence is also approved as a fixed-duration treatment for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL in combination with venetoclax in the US, and in combination with venetoclax, with or without obinutuzumab, in Europe, Canada, the U.K. and several other countries. Calquence\u00a0is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in the US, Europe, Japan and other countries. It is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy in China and several other countries.\nAs part of an extensive clinical development programme,\u00a0Calquence\u00a0is currently being evaluated as a single treatment and in combination with standard-of-care chemoimmunotherapy for patients with multiple B-cell blood cancers, including CLL, MCL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.\nAstraZeneca in haematology\nAstraZeneca is pushing the boundaries of science to redefine care in haematology.

Full results can be found in\nThe Lancet Respiratory Medicine\n.\nAlberto Papi, Professor and Chair of Respiratory Medicine at the University of Ferrara, and Director of the Respiratory Unit, CardioRespiratory Department, S. Anna University Hospital, Ferrara, Italy, and primary investigator, said: \u201cMany of the 262 million people worldwide living with asthma remain uncontrolled and still struggle with symptoms like frequent breathlessness, coughing and wheezing despite the use of dual maintenance therapy. The KALOS and LOGOS trials show that the single fixed-dose triple therapy budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol, which combines the efficacy of an ICS, LAMA, and LABA, improved lung function, and, importantly, prevented future severe exacerbations in patients, regardless of exacerbation history.\u201d\nSharon Barr, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, said: \u201cWith so many patients still experiencing the debilitating effects of uncontrolled asthma, we are excited about the potential for\nBreztri\nto improve lung function as well as prevent exacerbations in asthma. Building on its well-established profile in COPD, we hope to bring\nBreztri\nto patients with uncontrolled asthma as quickly as possible.\u201d\nThere were no new safety or tolerability signals identified for\nBreztri\nin KALOS or LOGOS.\nBreztri\nis an inhaled triple-combination therapy approved for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults in more than 80 countries worldwide including the US, EU, China and Japan. Regulatory filings for\nBreztri\nin asthma are currently under review in all major regions.\nNotes\nAsthma\nAsthma is a prevalent, chronic respiratory disease affecting as many as 262 million people worldwide,\n2\nincluding over 25 million in the US.\n3\nWhen uncontrolled, inflammation and muscle tightening in the airway (bronchoconstriction) may cause wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, coughing, and even death.\n2,4\nMany patients remain uncontrolled despite the availability of standard of care medicines and continue to experience significant limitations on lung function and reduced quality of life.\n5,6\nKALOS and LOGOS Phase III trials\nKALOS and LOGOS were replicate confirmatory, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multi-centre, 24-to-52-week variable length Phase III trials to assess the efficacy and safety of\nBreztri\nAerosphere\n(320/28.8/9.6\u03bcg and 320/14.4/9.6\u03bcg) compared with two fixed-dose, dual-combination therapies of budesonide, an ICS, and formoterol fumarate, a LABA:\nSymbicort\npressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) and PT009 (in an Aerosphere formulation).\n1,7,8\nKALOS and LOGOS included approximately 4,300 randomised patients.\nThe trial design was optimised to evaluate the 320/28.8/9.6\u03bcg dose of BGF. The primary efficacy endpoints for the two individual trials were the change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV\n1\n) area under the curve 0 to 3 hours (AUC\n0-3\n) at Week 24 and trough FEV\n1\nover 12-24 weeks and over 24 weeks.\n1,7,8\nThe primary endpoints and treatment comparisons in the KALOS and LOGOS trials differed according to regulatory submission approaches.

The Prescription Drug User Fee Act date, the FDA action date for its regulatory decision, is anticipated during the second quarter of 2026.\nThe sBLA is being reviewed under Project Orbis, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology medicines among participating international partners. This initiative is designed to bring effective cancer treatments to patients as early as possible.\nApproximately 70% of patients with metastatic TNBC are not candidates for immunotherapy, including all patients whose tumours do not express PD-L1 as well as patients with PD-L1-expressing tumours who cannot receive immunotherapy due to other factors. Chemotherapy remains the only approved 1st-line treatment for these patients.\n1,2\nSusan Galbraith, Executive Vice President, Oncology Haematology R&D, AstraZeneca, said: \u201c\nDatroway\nis the only medicine to significantly improve overall survival compared to chemotherapy in this patient population as demonstrated in the TROPION-Breast02 trial \u2013 the results of which are even more striking considering the trial enrolled a subset of patients with highly aggressive disease. The Priority Review of our submission underscores the impact of these results and its review under Project Orbis signals a widely shared commitment to bringing\nDatroway\nto patients around the world as quickly as possible.\u201d\nKen Takeshita, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo, said: \u201c\nDatroway\npotentially could be the first medicine approved in the 1st-line setting to significantly extend overall survival and nearly double the time without disease progression or death compared to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer for whom immunotherapy was not an option. We are eager to work with the FDA to bring this much needed treatment option to patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.\u201d\nThe sBLA is based on results from the TROPION-Breast02 Phase III trial which showed\nDatroway\ndemonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 5.0-month improvement in median overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.98; p=0.0291) and a 43% reduction in patients\u2019 risk of disease progression or death (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.47-0.69; p<0.0001) compared to chemotherapy as 1st-line treatment in this patient population.\nDatroway\nwas also associated with more robust and durable treatment responses, including an objective response rate (ORR) of 62.5% and duration of response (DoR) of 12.3 months, compared to an ORR of 29.3% and DoR of 7.1 months with chemotherapy. These\nresults\nwere presented at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress.\nThe safety profile of\nDatroway\nin TROPION-Breast02 was consistent with previous clinical trials of\nDatroway\nin breast cancer.\nAdditional regulatory submissions for\nDatroway\nin breast and lung cancer are underway globally.\nDatroway\nis a specifically engineered TROP2-directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo.\nNotes\nTriple-negative breast cancer\nTNBC accounts for approximately 15% of all breast cancer cases, with an estimated 345,000 diagnoses globally each year.\n3,4\nIn the US, an estimated 32,000 to 48,000 cases of TNBC were diagnosed in 2025.\n5,6\nTNBC is diagnosed more frequently in younger and premenopausal women, and is more prevalent in Black and Hispanic women.\n7-9\nMetastatic TNBC is the most aggressive type of breast cancer and has one of the worst prognoses, with median OS of just 12 to 18 months and only about 15% of patients living five years following diagnosis.\n7,10,11\nWhile some breast cancers may test positive for oestrogen receptors, progesterone receptors or overexpression of HER2, TNBC tests negative for all three.\n7\nDue to its aggressive nature and absence of common breast cancer receptors, TNBC is characteristically difficult to treat.\n7\nFor patients with metastatic disease with PD-L1 expressing tumours, the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy has improved outcomes in the 1st-line setting.\n12,13\nHowever, for the approximately 70% of patients with metastatic TNBC who are not candidates for immunotherapy, chemotherapy remains the only approved 1st-line treatment.\n1,2\nTROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in several solid tumours including TNBC.\n14\nTROP2 is associated with increased tumour progression and poor survival in patients with breast cancer.\n15,16\nTROPION-Breast02\nTROPION-Breast02 is a global, multicentre, randomised, open-label Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of\nDatroway\nversus investigator\u2019s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, capecitabine, carboplatin or eribulin) in patients with previously untreated locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC for whom immunotherapy was not an option. This included patients whose tumours did not express PD-L1 as well as patients with PD-L1 expressing tumours who could not receive immunotherapy due to prior exposure in early-stage disease, comorbidities or immunotherapy not being accessible in their geography. Enrollment included patients with de novo or recurrent disease, regardless of disease-free interval, and those with poor prognostic factors such as stable brain metastases.\nThe dual primary endpoints of TROPION-Breast02 are PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review and OS. Secondary endpoints include PFS as assessed by investigator, ORR, DoR, disease control rate, pharmacokinetics and safety.\nTROPION-Breast02 enrolled 644 patients at sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America.

    "full_text": "Update on US regulatory review of Saphnelo subcutaneous administration in systemic lupus erythematosus\nPUBLISHED\n3 February 2026\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a complete response letter (CRL) regarding the Biologics License Application (BLA) for\nSaphnelo\n(anifrolumab) for subcutaneous administration in adult patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). AstraZeneca subsequently provided the information requested in the CRL and is committed to working with the FDA to progress the application as quickly as possible.\nA decision from the FDA on the updated application for\nSaphnelo\nSC is expected in the first half of 2026. Intravenous (IV)\nSaphnelo\nremains commercially available.\nThe original BLA submitted to the FDA by AstraZeneca was based on a planned interim analysis of the Phase III TULIP-SC trial evaluating the subcutaneous administration of\nSaphnelo\n, which met the primary endpoint. The safety profile observed in the TULIP-SC trial was consistent with the known clinical profile of\nSaphnelo\nadministered as an intravenous (IV) infusion.\n1-4\nIn December 2025,\nAstraZeneca announced\nthe approval of\nSaphnelo\nin the European Union (EU) for subcutaneous administration in adult patients with moderate to severe SLE.\u00a0Since then, the full analysis of the TULIP-SC trial also demonstrated the subcutaneous administration of\nSaphnelo\nmet the primary endpoint of reduction in disease activity. These results were published in\nArthritis & Rheumatology\nin January 2026.\nSaphnelo\nIV infusion is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe SLE in more than 70 countries worldwide including the\u00a0US,\u00a0EU\u00a0and\u00a0Japan.\u00a0To date, more than 40,000 patients globally have been treated with\nSaphnelo\n.\n5\nFinancial considerations\nAstraZeneca\u00a0acquired\u00a0global rights to\nSaphnelo\nthrough an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Medarex, Inc. in 2004. The\u00a0option\u00a0for Medarex to co-promote the product expired on its acquisition by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) in 2009. Under the agreement, updated in 2025,\u00a0AstraZeneca will pay BMS a\u00a0mid-teens royalty for sales\u00a0in the US.\nNotes\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nSLE is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue in the body.\n6\nIt is a chronic and complex disease with a variety of clinical manifestations that can impact many organs and can cause a range of symptoms, including pain, rashes, fatigue, swelling in joints and fevers.\n6-9\nOver 3.4 million people globally are affected by SLE.\n10\nLiving with SLE can be painful, debilitating, and have a profound impact on patients\u2019 mental and financial wellbeing.\n9,11-15\nAn estimated 50% of people with SLE have irreversible organ damage within five years of diagnosis due to long-term corticosteroid use and disease activity.\n11,16\nEven a small reduction in daily steroid use (for example 1mg/day) can lower the risk of organ damage.\n17\nTULIP-SC\nTULIP-SC was a Phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a subcutaneous administration of anifrolumab versus placebo in participants aged 18 to 70 years with moderate to severe SLE while receiving standard therapy (oral corticosteroids, antimalarial, and/or immunosuppressants).\n18\nThe reduction of disease activity was measured using the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) at week 52.\n18\nThe BICLA requires improvement in all organs with disease activity at baseline with no new flares.\n18\nParticipants (367) were randomised 1:1 to receive 120mg subcutaneous dose of anifrolumab or placebo administered via a pre-filled, single-use syringe.\n18\nA planned interim analysis was conducted when the first 220 participants reached week 52.\n18\nThe trial also includes an open-label extension period of 52 weeks for participants who completed the 52-week treatment period.\n18\nSaphnelo\nSaphnelo\n(anifrolumab) is a first-in-class, fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to subunit 1 of the type I interferon (IFN) receptor, blocking the activity of type I IFN.\n2,19\nType I IFNs, such as IFN-alpha, IFN-beta and IFN-kappa, are cytokines involved in regulating the inflammatory pathways implicated in SLE.\n20-25\nSaphnelo\nIV is the first biologic with remission data in SLE from a four-year placebo-controlled Phase III trial (TULIP-LTE) and was measured with the DORIS criteria for remission.\n26,27\nDORIS is measured as clinical SLEDAI-2K, or \u201cSystemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000\u201d score of 0, physician global assessment <0.5, prednisolone/ equivalent dose of OCS dose of \u22645 mg per day and stable maintenance doses of immunosuppressants, including biologics.\n28\nSaphnelo\ncontinues to be evaluated in diseases where type I IFN plays a key role, including Phase III trials in cutaneous lupus erythematosus, myositis, systemic sclerosis and lupus nephritis.\n29-32\nAstraZeneca in Respiratory & Immunology\nRespiratory & Immunology, part of AstraZeneca BioPharmaceuticals, is a key disease area and growth driver to the Company.\nAstraZeneca is an established leader in respiratory care with a 50-year heritage and a growing portfolio of medicines in immune-mediated diseases.

The regimen includes neoadjuvant\nImfinzi\nin combination with chemotherapy before surgery, followed by adjuvant\nImfinzi\nin combination with chemotherapy, then\nImfinzi\nmonotherapy.\nThe Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency based its positive opinion on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) data from the MATTERHORN Phase III trial\n.\nThe EFS results were presented\u00a0during the Plenary Session at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and simultaneously published in\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\n.\nIn a planned interim analysis, patients treated with the\nImfinzi\n-based perioperative regimen showed a 29% reduction in the risk of disease progression, recurrence or death versus chemotherapy alone (based on an EFS hazard ratio [HR] of 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58\u20130.86; p<0.001). Estimated median EFS was not yet reached for the\nImfinzi\narm versus 32.8 months for the comparator arm. An estimated 78.2% of patients treated with the\nImfinzi\n-based perioperative regimen were event-free at one year, compared to 74.0% in the comparator arm; the estimated 24-month EFS rate was 67.4% versus 58.5%, respectively.\nIn the final OS analysis, results showed the\nImfinzi\nand FLOT perioperative regimen demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful survival improvement, reducing the risk of death by 22% compared to chemotherapy alone (based on a HR of 0.78; 95% CI 0.63-0.96; p=0.021). An estimated 69% of patients treated with the\nImfinzi\n-based regimen were alive at three years compared with 62% in the comparator arm. At each subsequent prespecified OS landmark, the survival curves indicated increasing separation, signaling a greater magnitude of benefit over time for the\nImfinzi\n-based regimen. An OS benefit was observed regardless of PD-L1 status. OS results from MATTERHORN were presented in a Proffered Paper session at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2025.\nJosep Tabernero, MD, PhD, head of the Medical Oncology Department at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital and director of the Vall d\u2019Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) in\u00a0 Barcelona, Spain, and principal investigator in the MATTERHORN trial, said: This recommendation signals a major step forward for patients in the EU with early gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers, who have historically faced high rates of recurrence and poor long-term outcomes despite curative-intent surgery and chemotherapy. This durvalumab-based perioperative regimen is the first immunotherapy approach to significantly extend survival in this setting, and if approved, should set a new standard of care.\u201d\nSusan Galbraith, Executive Vice President, Oncology Haematology R&D, AstraZeneca, said:\u00a0\u201c\nImfinzi\nplus FLOT demonstrated a durable, increasing long-term survival benefit in the MATTERHORN trial, with more than two-thirds of patients alive at three years. The CHMP recommendation marks further progress toward our goal to offer novel approaches in early-stage cancers where there is the greatest chance for cure and brings us closer to providing the third perioperative\nImfinzi\n-based regimen in the EU.\u201d\nGastric cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death globally, with nearly one million people diagnosed each year.\n1\nIn 2024, there were roughly 43,000 drug-treated patients in the US, EU and Japan in early-stage and locally advanced gastric or GEJ cancer.\n2\nApproximately 62,000 patients in these regions are expected to be newly diagnosed in this setting by 2030.\n3\nThe safety profile for\nImfinzi\nand FLOT chemotherapy was consistent with the known profiles of each medicine, and the percentage of patients that completed surgery was similar compared to chemotherapy alone. Grade 3 or higher adverse events due to any cause were similar between the two arms (71.6% for\nImfinzi\nand FLOT arm; 71.2% for comparator arm).\nImfinzi\nis\napproved in the US\nand other countries in this same indication based on the MATTERHORN results. Regulatory applications are currently under review in Japan and several other countries.\nNotes\nGastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers\nGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fifth-highest leading cause of cancer mortality.\n1\nNearly one million new patients were diagnosed with gastric cancer in 2022, with approximately 660,000 deaths reported globally.\n1\nIn many regions, its incidence has been increasing in patients younger than 50 years old, along with other gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies.\n4\nGEJ cancer is a type of gastric cancer that arises from and spans the area where the oesophagus connects to the stomach.\n5\nDisease recurrence is common in patients with resectable gastric cancer despite undergoing surgery with curative intent and treatment with neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy.\n6\nApproximately one in four patients with gastric cancer who undergo surgery develop recurrent disease within one year, and the five-year survival rate remains poor, with less than half of patients alive at five years.\n6-7\nMATTERHORN\nMATTERHORN is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, global Phase III trial evaluating\nImfinzi\nas perioperative treatment for patients with resectable Stage II-IVA gastric and GEJ cancers. Perioperative therapy includes treatment before and after surgery, also known as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy. In the trial, 948 patients were randomised to receive a 1500mg fixed dose of\nImfinzi\nplus FLOT chemotherapy or placebo plus FLOT chemotherapy every four weeks for two cycles prior to surgery. This was followed by\nImfinzi\nor placebo every four weeks for up to 12 cycles after surgery (including two cycles of\nImfinzi\nor placebo plus FLOT chemotherapy and 10 additional cycles of\nImfinzi\nor placebo monotherapy).\nIn the MATTERHORN trial, the primary endpoint is EFS, defined as time from randomisation until the date of one of the following events (whichever occurred first): RECIST (version 1.1, per blinded independent central review assessment) progression that precludes surgery or requires non-protocol therapy during the neoadjuvant period; RECIST progression/recurrence during the adjuvant period; non-RECIST progression that precludes surgery or requires non-protocol therapy during the neoadjuvant period or discovered during surgery; progression/recurrence confirmed by biopsy post-surgery; or death due to any cause. Key secondary endpoints include pathologic complete response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who have no detectable cancer cells in resected tumour tissue following neoadjuvant therapy, and OS. The trial enrolled participants in 176 centres in 20 countries, including in the US, Canada, Europe, South America and Asia.\nImfinzi\nImfinzi\n(durvalumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-L1 protein and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 and CD80 proteins, countering the tumour's immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.\nIn GI cancer,\nImfinzi\nis approved in combination with chemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC) and in combination with\nImjudo\n(tremelimumab) in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nImfinzi\nis also approved as a monotherapy in unresectable HCC in Japan and the EU.\nIn addition to its indications in GI cancers,\nImfinzi\nis the global standard of care based on OS in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients whose disease has not progressed after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Additionally,\nImfinzi\nis approved as a perioperative treatment in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in resectable NSCLC, and in combination with a short course of\nImjudo\nand chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC.\nImfinzi\nis also approved for limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in patients whose disease has not progressed following concurrent platinum-based CRT; and in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of extensive-stage SCLC.\nPerioperative\nImfinzi\nin combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is approved in the US, EU, Japan and other countries for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer based on results from the NIAGARA Phase III trial. Additionally, in May 2025,\nImfinzi\nadded to Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin induction and maintenance therapy met the primary endpoint of disease-free survival for patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the POTOMAC Phase III trial.\nImfinzi\nin combination with chemotherapy followed by\nImfinzi\nmonotherapy is approved as a 1st-line treatment for primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (mismatch repair deficient disease only in the US and EU).\nImfinzi\nin combination with chemotherapy followed by\nLynparza\n(olaparib) and\nImfinzi\nis approved for patients with mismatch repair proficient advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer in the EU and Japan.\nSince the first approval in May 2017, more than 414,000 patients have been treated with\nImfinzi\n. As part of a broad development programme,\nImfinzi\nis being tested as a single treatment and in combinations with other anti-cancer treatments for patients with NSCLC, bladder cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and several GI cancers.\nAstraZeneca in GI cancers\nAstraZeneca has a broad development programme for the treatment of GI cancers across several medicines and a variety of tumour types and stages of disease. In 2022, GI cancers collectively represented approximately 5 million new cancer cases leading to approximately 3.3 million deaths.8\nWithin this programme, the Company is committed to improving outcomes in gastric, liver, biliary tract, oesophageal, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers.\nIn addition to its indications in BTC and HCC,\nImfinzi\nis being assessed in combinations, including with\nImjudo\n, in liver, oesophageal and gastric cancers in an extensive development programme spanning early to late-stage disease across settings.\nEnhertu\n(trastuzumab deruxtecan), a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC), is approved in the US and several other countries for HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer.\nEnhertu\nis jointly developed and commercialised by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo.\nLynparza\n, a first-in-class PARP inhibitor, is approved in the US and several other countries for the treatment of BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic cancer.\nLynparza\nis developed and commercialised in collaboration with MSD (Merck & Co., Inc. inside the US and Canada).\nThe Company is also assessing rilvegostomig, a PD-1/TIGIT bispecific antibody, in combination with chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy in BTC, in combination with bevacizumab with or without\nImjudo\nas a 1st-line treatment in patients with advanced HCC, and as a 1st-line treatment in patients with HER2-negative, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric and GEJ cancers. Rilvegostomig is also being evaluated in combination with\nEnhertu\nin previously untreated, HER2-expressing, locally advanced or metastatic BTC.\nAstraZeneca is advancing multiple modalities that provide complementary mechanisms for targeting Claudin 18.2, a promising therapeutic target in gastric cancer. These include sonesitatug vedotin, a potential first-in-class ADC licensed from KYM Biosciences Inc., currently in Phase III development; AZD5863, a novel Claudin 18.2/CD3 T-cell engager bispecific antibody licensed from Harbour Biomed in Phase I development; and AZD4360, an antibody drug conjugate, currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II trial in patients with advanced solid tumours.\nIn early development, AstraZeneca is developing C-CAR031 / AZD7003, a Glypican 3 (GPC3) armoured CAR T, in HCC. C-CAR031 / AZD7003 is being co-developed with AbelZeta in China where it is under evaluation in an IIT.\nAstraZeneca in immuno-oncology (IO)\nAstraZeneca is a pioneer in introducing the concept of immunotherapy into dedicated clinical areas of high unmet medical need. The Company has a comprehensive and diverse IO portfolio and pipeline anchored in immunotherapies designed to overcome evasion of the anti-tumour immune response and stimulate the body\u2019s immune system to attack tumours.\nAstraZeneca strives to redefine cancer care and help transform outcomes for patients with\nImfinzi\nas a monotherapy and in combination with\nImjudo\nas well as other novel immunotherapies and modalities. The Company is also investigating next-generation immunotherapies like bispecific antibodies and therapeutics that harness different aspects of immunity to target cancer, including cell therapy and T-cell engagers.\nAstraZeneca is pursuing an innovative clinical strategy to bring IO-based therapies that deliver long-term survival to new settings across a wide range of cancer types. The Company is focused on exploring novel combination approaches to help prevent treatment resistance and drive longer immune responses. With an extensive clinical programme, the Company also champions the use of IO treatment in earlier disease stages, where there is the greatest potential for cure.\nAstraZeneca in\noncology\nAstraZeneca is leading a revolution in oncology with the ambition to provide cures for cancer in every form, following the science to understand cancer and all its complexities to discover, develop and deliver life-changing medicines to patients.\nThe Company's focus is on some of the most challenging cancers. It is through persistent innovation that AstraZeneca has built one of the most diverse portfolios and pipelines in the industry, with the potential to catalyse changes in the practice of medicine and transform the patient experience.\nAstraZeneca has the vision to redefine cancer care and, one day, eliminate cancer as a cause of death.\nAstraZeneca\nAstraZeneca (LSE/STO/NYSE: AZN) is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialisation of prescription medicines in Oncology, Rare Diseases, and\u00a0BioPharmaceuticals, including Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism, and Respiratory & Immunology.

The data showed that more patients treated with nipocalimab\nachieved the stringent primary endpoint of a durable hemoglobin response compared with placebo. A durable response was defined as achieving a hemoglobin level above 10 g/dL and an increase of at least 2 g/dL for at least 28 days, without the need for rescue therapy.\n5\nIn addition to a rapid and durable improvement in hemoglobin, more patients treated with IMAAVY\n\u00ae\nexperienced rapid and sustained improvement in fatigue as assessed by FACIT-Fatigue, an outcome of significant importance to people living with wAIHA.\n5\n\u201cThe ENERGY study demonstrated clinically meaningful results in adults living with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia,\u201d said Bruno Fattizzo, M.D., Assistant Professor at the Department of Oncology and Hematology-Oncology, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano\nc\n. \u201cThese results provide a strong rationale for the potential of IMAAVY to rapidly improve fatigue and provide durable hemoglobin response while maintaining favorable tolerability.\u201d\nIMAAVY\n\u00ae\nwas generally well tolerated in ENERGY, with no new safety signals identified and a safety profile consistent with the IMAAVY\n\u00ae\nlabel.\n5,6\nIMAAVY\n\u00ae\nwas\napproved\nin the United States in April 2025 for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older who are acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibody positive.\n6\nThe full results of the ENERGY trial are forthcoming.\nEditor\u2019s notes:\nDurable hemoglobin response = hemoglobin concentration \u226510 g/dL\nand\nan increase from baseline in Hgb \u22652 g/dL for at least 28 days\nIMAAVY\n\u00ae\nis not approved in wAIHA\nDr. Fattizzo has served as a consultant to J&J; he has not been paid for any media work\nABOUT THE ENERGY TRIAL\nENERGY (\nNCT04119050\n) is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of nipocalimab compared with placebo, followed by an open-label extension period, in adults living with wAIHA.\n5\nABOUT WARM AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA (wAIHA)\nWarm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) is a rare, life-threatening condition where autoantibodies attach to and destroy red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in anemia. Approximately 1-3 new people per 100,000 are affected by wAIHA per year, and about 1 in 8,000 individuals are living with the condition.\n1,7\nThis condition affects both women and men, and can affect people at any age with incidence increasing over the age of 50.\n8,9\nAdditionally, people with wAIHA are at increased risk of other serious complications such as venous thrombotic events, acute renal failure, and infection.\n10\nThere are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs indicated for wAIHA, and treatment typically consists of unapproved corticosteroids, broad immunosuppressants, and B-cell directed therapies.\n7\nWith an unmet need for treatment in wAIHA, novel therapies like nipocalimab that can deliver meaningful improvement to patients is critical.\n9\nABOUT IMAAVY\n\u00ae\n(nipocalimab-aahu)\nIMAAVY\n\u00ae\nis an immunoselective treatment designed to target, bind with high affinity, and block FcRn, reducing circulating IgG antibodies that drive disease while also preserving key immune functions. IMAAVY\n\u00ae\nis currently approved for the treatment of gMG in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older who are AChR or MuSK antibody positive.\n6\nNipocalimab is being investigated across three key segments in the autoantibody space including Rheumatologic diseases, Rare Autoantibody diseases, and Maternal Fetal diseases mediated by maternal alloantibodies, in which blockade of IgG binding to FcRn in the placenta is believed to limit transplacental transfer of maternal alloantibodies to the fetus.\n11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted several key designations to nipocalimab including:\nU.S. FDA Fast Track designation in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) in July 2019, gMG in December 2021, fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia) FNAIT in March 2024 and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease (SjD) in March 2025\nU.S. FDA Orphan drug status for wAIHA in December 2019, HDFN in June 2020, gMG in February 2021, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in October 2021 and FNAIT in December 2023\nU.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for HDFN in February 2024 and for SjD in November 2024\nU.S. FDA granted Priority Review in gMG in Q4 2024\nEU EMA Orphan medicinal product designation for HDFN in October 2019 and FNAIT in April 2025\nThe legal manufacturer for IMAAVY\n\u00ae\nis Janssen Biotech, Inc.\nWHAT IS IMAAVY\n\u00ae\n(nipocalimab-aahu)?\nIMAAVY\n\u00ae\nis a prescription medicine used to treat adults and children 12 years of age and older with a disease called generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive.\nIt is not known if IMAAVY\n\u00ae\nis safe and effective in children under 12 years of age.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nWhat is the most important information I should know about IMAAVY\n\u00ae\n?\nIMAAVY\n\u00ae\nis a prescription medicine that may cause serious side effects, including:\n\u00b7\nInfections\nare a common side effect of IMAAVY\n\u00ae\nthat can be serious.

    "full_text": "BEERSE, BELGIUM (23 February 2026)\n-\nJohnson & Johnson\ntoday announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved an extension of the RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n\u25bc (amivantamab) marketing authorisation to include additional subcutaneous (SC) dosing regimens. With this decision, SC amivantamab is now authorised for use across all previously approved intravenous (IV) amivantamab indications, including:\n6\nEvery-four-week (Q4W) SC amivantamab dosing regimen:\n6\n\u00b7 in combination with LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n\u25bc(lazertinib) for first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations\n\u00b7 as monotherapy for adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations after failure of platinum-based therapy\nEvery-three-week (Q3W) SC amivantamab dosing regimen in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for adult patients with advanced NSCLC:\n6\n\u00b7 with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations after failure of prior therapy, including an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)\n\u00b7 with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, as first-line treatment\n\u201cThe approval of additional subcutaneous dosing options represents a step forward in how we can deliver amivantamab in clinical practice for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer,\u201d said Silvia Novello, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medical Oncology in the Oncology Department at San Luigi Hospital in Orbassano, University of Turin, Italy.** \u201cHaving the option to transition from every-two-week to every-four-week dosing allows us to better align treatment with individual patient needs. These subcutaneous regimens have demonstrated efficacy and safety consistent with the intravenous formulation, while offering practical advantages like reduced time in clinic, and fewer administration-related reactions, making a real difference for both patients and healthcare teams.\u201d\nThe approval is supported by results from the Phase 2 PALOMA-2 and Phase 1 PALOMA studies, evaluating the feasibility of SC administration, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of SC amivantamab in multiple regimens in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC, including the Q3W and Q4W dosing regimens.\n1,2,3,4,5\nResults demonstrated that treatment with SC amivantamab resulted in a response rate and safety profile consistent with historical IV amivantamab dosing, but with a significantly reduced incidence of administration-related reactions (ARRs).\n1,2,3,4,5\nAdministration time with SC amivantamab was faster, approximately five minutes compared to five hours for the first IV amivantamab infusion.\n1,2,3,4,5\nConsistent with IV amivantamab, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were EGFR- and MET-related. These included dermatitis acneiform, paronychia, rash, stomatitis, and hypoalbuminemia.\n1,2,3,4,5\n\u201cThe approval of these new subcutaneous dosing regimens marks an important step in\nJohnson & Johnson\n\u2019s commitment to transforming the treatment journey for patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer,\u201d said Henar Hevia, Ph.D., Senior Director, EMEA Therapeutic Area Head, Oncology,\nJohnson & Johnson\nInnovative Medicine. \u201cBy offering more flexible and convenient options, we aim to reduce the burden of treatment on patients and their caregivers across all approved indications, while maintaining the well-established efficacy of intravenous amivantamab. This milestone reflects our broader mission to deliver therapies that not only extend and improve lives but also prioritise the experience of those receiving them.\u201d\nAbout the PALOMA Study\nPALOMA (\nNCT04606381\n), is an open-label, multicentre, dose escalation Phase 1b study which assessed the feasibility of SC administration of amivantamab based on safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients with advanced solid tumours who may benefit from EGFR-or MET-directed therapy, to determine a dose, dose regimen and formulation for SC amivantamab delivery.\n1,3,7\nAbout the PALOMA-2 Study\nPALOMA-2 (\nNCT05498428\n) is an open-label Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and PK of first and second-line SC amivantamab (administered via manual injection) as a monotherapy or combined with lazertinib and/or chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.\n2,4,5,8\nThe primary endpoints are safety and objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1*.\n8\nAbout Amivantamab\nAmivantamab is a fully-human EGFR-MET bispecific antibody that acts by targeting tumours with activating and resistance EGFR mutations and MET mutations and amplifications, and by harnessing the immune system.\n6,9,10,11\nThe European Commission (EC) has previously approved amivantamab in the following indications:\n6\nIntravenous amivantamab:\n\u00b7 In combination with lazertinib for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations.\n\u00b7 In combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for the treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations after failure of prior therapy, including an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).\n\u00b7 In combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.\n\u00b7 As monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations after failure of platinum-based therapy.\nSubcutaneous amivantamab:\n\u00b7 In combination with lazertinib for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon\u202f19 deletions or exon\u202f21 L858R substitution mutations.\n\u00b7 As monotherapy for treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with activating EGFR exon\u202f20 insertion mutations, after failure of platinum-based therapy.\nSubcutaneous (SC) amivantamab is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme\u2019s ENHANZE\n\u00ae\ndrug delivery technology.\n12\nFor a full list of adverse events and information on dosage and administration, contraindications and other precautions when using amivantamab, please refer to the\nSummary of Product Characteristics\n.\n6\n\u25bc In line with EU regulations for new medicines, amivantamab is subject to additional monitoring.\nAbout Lazertinib\nIn 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc. entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of lazertinib. Lazertinib is an oral, third-generation, brain-penetrant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets both the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing wild-type EGFR.\n13\nAn analysis of the efficacy and safety of lazertinib from the Phase 3 study LASER301 was published in\nThe Journal of Clinical Oncology\nin 2023.\n13\nIn January 2025, the European Commission approved a marketing authorisation for lazertinib, in combination with amivantamab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations.\n14\nFor a full list of adverse events and information on dosage and administration, contraindications and other precautions when using lazertinib, please refer to the\nSummary of Product Characteristics\n.\n15\n\u25bc In line with EU regulations for new medicines, lazertinib is subject to additional monitoring.\nAbout Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nIn Europe, it is estimated that 484,306 people were diagnosed with lung cancer in 2022.\n16\nNSCLC accounts for 85 percent of all lung cancer cases.\n17\nLung cancer is Europe\u2019s biggest cancer killer, with more deaths than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined.\n16\nThe main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.\n17\nAmong the most common driver mutations in NSCLC are alterations in EGFR, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase controlling cell growth and division.\n17,18\nEGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15 percent of Western patients with NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology and occur in 40 to 50 percent of Asian patients.\n19,20,21,22\nEGFR ex19del or EGFR exon 21 L858R mutations are the most common EGFR mutations.\n23\nThe five-year survival rate for all patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR mutations treated with EGFR TKIs is less than 20 percent and between 25-32 percent of patients receiving the current first-line standard of care, osimertinib, do not survive long enough to reach second-line treatment.\n24,25,26,27,28,29,30\nEGFR exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations are the third most prevalent activating EGFR mutation.\n31\nPatients with EGFR ex20ins mutations have a real-world five-year OS of eight percent in the frontline setting, which is worse than patients with EGFR ex19del or L858R mutations, who have a real-world five-year OS of 19 percent.\n25\nAbout\nJohnson & Johnson\nAt\nJohnson & Johnson\n, we believe health is everything.

    "full_text": "Stockholm, Sweden, (February 21, 2026)\n\u2013\nJohnson & Johnson\n(NYSE: JNJ) today announced new long-term data from the QUASAR long-term extension (LTE) study showing that TREMFYA\n\u00ae\n(guselkumab) sustained clinical, endoscopic, and histologic outcomes through Week 140 in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). These data are among the 30 company-sponsored abstracts being presented at the European Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) 2026 conference.\nAt Week 140, 80.8% of patients taking TREMFYA\n\u00ae\nwere in clinical remission\na\n. Additionally, 78.6% of patients achieved histo-endoscopic mucosal improvement (HEMI)\nb\n, and 53.6% of patients were in endoscopic remission\nc\n, respectively.\nd\nApproximately 89% of eligible study participants combined completed treatment through Week 140. Nearly all participants who achieved clinical remission at Week 140 were corticosteroid-free for at least eight weeks.\n1\nThe study also showed that of those in clinical remission at Week 44, 87.5% maintained clinical remission through Week 140. Efficacy was sustained regardless of prior biologic and/or JAK inhibitor treatment history, and no new safety concerns were observed.\n1\n\u201cUlcerative colitis is a lifelong condition that can significantly impact patients\u2019 overall health and they need treatment options that remain effective and well-tolerated over time,\u201d said Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet, MD, PhD, study investigator.\ne\n\u201cThe QUASAR long-term study shows the sustained ability of TREMFYA to deliver durable results, with consistent outcomes regardless of previous biologic or JAK inhibitor treatment. With high study retention and no new safety concerns over this extended time period, the data strengthen confidence in the long-term use of TREMFYA in ulcerative colitis.\u201d\n\u201cThese findings highlight the endoscopic outcomes that can be achieved with TREMFYA, raising expectations for what is possible for patients with ulcerative colitis,\u201d said Esi Lamous\u00e9-Smith, MD, PhD, Vice President, Gastroenterology Disease Area Lead, Immunology,\nJohnson & Johnson\n. \u201cPatients who achieve endoscopic remission experience fewer flare-ups and are less likely to need steroids or require surgery over time. We are energized by these findings and remain focused on delivering treatments that help more patients achieve meaningful, lasting disease control.\u201d\nTREMFYA\n\u00ae\nis the first and only approved, dual-acting monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-23 while also binding to CD64, a receptor on cells that produce IL-23. IL-23 is a cytokine secreted by activated monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells that is known to be a driver of immune-mediated diseases. Findings are based on\nin vitro\nstudies.\n2 3 4 5 6\nTREMFYA\n\u00ae\nhas received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Commission (EC) approval for both SC and IV induction options for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease and U.S. FDA approval for both SC and IV induction options for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. TREMFYA\n\u00ae\nis approved by the EC for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and is currently administered via an IV induction regimen, followed by a SC maintenance regimen.\nTwo other\nJohnson & Johnson\n-sponsored abstracts were selected as Top 10 oral abstracts by ECCO, highlighting continued commitment to providing treatment options to those with inflammatory bowel disease:\nResults from the Phase 2b ANTHEM-UC study of icotrokinra, the first targeted oral peptide that selectively blocks the interleukin-23 receptor, demonstrating its impact on systemic and tissue biomarkers of inflammatory burden in UC.\n7\nPrimary safety results from the UNITI Jr study of STELARA\n\u00ae\n(ustekinumab) showing that it was effective and well-tolerated, with no new safety signals, in treating pediatric patients with Crohn\u2019s disease.\n8\nFor a full list of all\nJohnson & Johnson\ndata being presented at ECCO visit:\nhttps://www.jnj.com/innovativemedicine/immunology/gastroenterology\n.\nEditor\u2019s Notes:\na. Clinical remission was defined as a Mayo stool frequency subscore of 0 or 1 and not increased from induction baseline, a Mayo rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and a Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES) of 0 or 1.\nb. Histo-endoscopic mucosal improvement was defined as a combination of endoscopic improvement and histologic improvement (neutrophil infiltration in <5% of crypts, no crypts destruction, and no erosions, ulcerations or granulation tissue according to the Geboes grading system.\nc. Endoscopic remission (normalization) was defined as a MES of 0.\nd. As observed. Data were analyzed using 2 methods: \u2018nonresponder imputation\u2019 (NRI) accounting for patients with treatment failure or missing data, and \u2018as observed\u2019. NRI results were consistent with as observed.\ne. Dr. Laurent Peyrin-Biroulet is a paid consultant for\nJohnson & Johnson\n. He has not been compensated for any media work.\nAbout the QUASAR Program (\nNCT04033445\n)\nQUASAR is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter, Phase 2b/3 program designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TREMFYA\n\u00ae\nin adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy (e.g., thiopurines or corticosteroids), prior biologics (TNF antagonists or vedolizumab) and/or JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib). QUASAR included a Phase 2b dose-ranging induction study, a confirmatory Phase 3 induction study, and a Phase 3 randomized withdrawal maintenance study. In the Phase 3 induction study, patients received either TREMFYA\n\u00ae\n200 mg or placebo by IV infusion at Weeks 0, 4, and 8. In the Phase 3 maintenance study, patients received a SC maintenance regimen of either TREMFYA\n\u00ae\n200 mg q4w, TREMFYA\u00ae 100 mg q8w, or placebo. The ongoing long-term extension study provides an additional 4 years of treatment. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and biomarkers are assessed at specified time points.\n9\nAbout ANTHEM-UC (NCT06049017)\nANTHEM-UC is a Phase 2b multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra (JNJ-77242113, JNJ-2113) in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy (e.g., thiopurines or corticosteroids), prior biologics (TNF antagonists or vedolizumab) and/or ozanimod or approved JAK inhibitors. The study is evaluating three once-daily dosages of icotrokinra taken orally. Participants who complete the Week 28 assessments and have achieved clinical response at Week 28 and who, in the opinion of the investigator, will continue to benefit from treatment with study intervention will continue in the 48-week long term extension (LTE) period and receive the same treatment up to Week 76.\n10\nAbout UNITI JR (NCT04673357)\nUNITI-Jr is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of ustekinumab in 48 pediatric patients (aged 2-17) with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease (defined by a Pediatric Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index [PCDAI] score >30) through 52 weeks of treatment (8 weeks of induction and 44 weeks of maintenance treatment).1,3 The study included an open-label induction treatment with a single ustekinumab intravenous dose of approximately 6mg/kg followed by a randomized double-blind subcutaneous maintenance regimen of 90mg administered either every 8 weeks or every 12 weeks.\nAbout Ulcerative Colitis\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic disease of the large intestine, also known as the colon, in which the lining of the colon becomes inflamed and develops tiny open sores, or ulcers, that produce pus and mucus. It is the result of the immune system\u2019s overactive response. Symptoms vary but may typically include loose and more urgent bowel movements, rectal bleeding or bloody stool, persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue.\n11\nAbout Crohn\u2019s Disease\nCrohn\u2019s disease is one of the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease, which affects an estimated three million Americans and an estimated four million people across Europe.\n12 13\nCrohn\u2019s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with no known cause, but the disease is associated with abnormalities of the immune system that could be triggered by a genetic predisposition, diet, or other environmental factors.\n14\nSymptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease can vary, but often include abdominal pain and tenderness, frequent diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, and fever.\nCurrently no cure is available for Crohn\u2019s disease.\n15\nAbout TREMFYA\n\u00ae\n(guselkumab)\nDeveloped by\nJohnson & Johnson\n, TREMFYA\n\u00ae\nis the first fully-human, dual-acting monoclonal antibody designed to neutralize inflammation at the cellular source by blocking IL-23 and binding to CD64 (a receptor on cells that produce IL-23). Findings for the dual-acting mechanism are limited to\nin vitro\nstudies that demonstrate guselkumab binds to CD64, which is expressed on the surface of IL-23 producing cells in an inflammatory monocyte model. The clinical significance of this finding is not known.\nTREMFYA\n\u00ae\nis a prescription medicine approved in the U.S. to treat:\nadults and children 6 years and older who also weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet or UV light).\nadults and children 6 years and older who also weigh at least 88 pounds (40 kg) with active psoriatic arthritis.\nadults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.\nadults with moderately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease.\nTREMFYA\n\u00ae\nis approved in Europe, Canada, Japan, and a number of other countries for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, adults with active psoriatic arthritis, adults with moderate-to-severe Crohn\u2019s disease and adults with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.\nThe legal manufacturer for TREMFYA\n\u00ae\nis Janssen Biotech, Inc.\nJohnson & Johnson\nmaintains exclusive worldwide marketing rights to TREMFYA\n\u00ae\n.

    "full_text": "RARITAN, N.J., February 19, 2026\n\u2013\nJohnson & Johnson\n(NYSE:JNJ) today announced new results from the Phase 1b/2 OrigAMI-4 study showing that first-line treatment with investigational subcutaneous amivantamab and hyaluronidase-lpuj in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor delivered clinically meaningful and durable antitumor activity in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) that is recurrent or metastatic, PD-L1-positive, and human papillomavirus (HPV)-unrelated. Data were presented during a plenary session at the 2026 Multidisciplinary Head and Neck Cancers Symposium (MHNCS) (Abstract #2).\n1\nHead and neck squamous cell carcinoma is an aggressive disease, and many patients see their cancer return or spread after their initial diagnosis. In the first-line recurrent or metastatic setting, outcomes remain poor with current standard of care. PD-1 monotherapy has historically achieved response rates of approximately 18 percent, and only modest improvements are seen when chemotherapy is added, leaving many patients without meaningful benefit.\n2,3\nThis underscores the need for approaches that address additional drivers of disease including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\nand mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), which contribute to tumor growth and treatment resistance.\n4,5,6\nData from lung cancer, where these same pathways have been well characterized, suggest that targeting both may change disease biology and improve outcomes.\n7\n\u201cFrom a clinical perspective, rapid and durable disease control is an important goal in the first-line treatment of head and neck cancer,\u201d said Ranee Mehra,* M.D., Director of Head and Neck Medical Oncology and Professor of Medicine at the Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Maryland. \u201cCombining subcutaneous amivantamab with immunotherapy is promising because it targets key drivers of tumor growth and resistance, which is resulting in deeper responses compared with current standards. Continued research will be important to build on these findings and better understand how this approach may fit into first-line treatment.\u201d\nDetailed Study Results\nIn Cohort 2 of the OrigAMI-4 study, treatment with subcutaneous amivantamab plus pembrolizumab, administered every three weeks, demonstrated a confirmed overall response rate of 56 percent (22/39; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 40-72), including six complete responses (four confirmed at the time of analysis, which represents a 10 percent complete response rate) and 18 partial responses (all confirmed). At a median follow-up of 10.4 months (range, 1.6-12.5), 46 percent of patients remained on treatment. Tumor shrinkage of target lesions was observed in 82 percent of patients. The clinical benefit rate, defined as confirmed response or durable stable disease, was 74 percent (29/39; 95 percent CI, 58-87). Responses occurred rapidly, with a median time to first response of 9.7 weeks, and treatment was ongoing in 64 percent of confirmed responders (14/22) at the time of data cutoff. Median progression-free survival was 7.7 months (95 percent CI, 5.0-not estimable). The median overall survival was not estimable.\n1\nThe safety profile of subcutaneous amivantamab and pembrolizumab was consistent with those of the individual agents, with no new safety signals identified. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, occurring in more than 30 percent of patients, were rash (49 percent), paronychia (46 percent), hypoalbuminemia (41 percent), dermatitis acneiform (38 percent), increased aspartate aminotransferase (38 percent), increased alanine aminotransferase (36 percent), and stomatitis (36 percent). Administration-related reactions occurred in six (15 percent) patients, none of which were Grade 3 or higher. Treatment discontinuation due to treatment-related adverse events occurred in four patients.\n1\n\u201cThe standard of care in the first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer is inadequate for many patients, with low response rates and short durations of benefit,\u201d said Joshua Bauml, M.D., Vice President, Lung and Head and Neck Cancer Disease Area Leader,\nJohnson & Johnson\n. \u201cSeeing rapid and durable disease control at levels meaningfully higher than what has historically been achieved signals the potential to redefine what treatment can offer patients. Subcutaneous amivantamab is built on a mechanism of action that has already changed disease biology and improved outcomes in\nEGFR\n-mutated lung cancer, and these new results suggest we may be able to deliver more meaningful benefit for patients in another setting where the status quo is simply not good enough and unmet need remains high.\u201d\nThese data support continued evaluation of RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\u2122\n-based regimens in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, including the ongoing Phase 3 OrigAMI-5 study (\nNCT07276399\n) assessing subcutaneous amivantamab with carboplatin and pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment in patients with HPV-unrelated recurrent or metastatic disease, regardless of PD-L1 expression, where significant unmet need persists.\n8\nAbout the OrigAMI-4 Study\nOrigAMI-4 (\nNCT06385080\n) is an open-label Phase 1b/2 study evaluating RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\u2122\n(amivantamab and hyaluronidase-lpuj) in recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). The study includes five cohorts exploring RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\u2122\nacross different treatment settings and regimens.\nCohort 1 evaluated RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\u2122\nas monotherapy in patients with HPV-unrelated R/M HNSCC who had received prior platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Patients with prior anti-\nEGFR\ntherapy were excluded. Cohort 2 is evaluating RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\u2122\nin combination with pembrolizumab in patients with HPV-unrelated recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who have not yet received treatment for their advanced disease and whose tumors express PD-L1.\nRYBREVANT\nFASPRO\u2122\nwas administered on a weekly schedule during the initial treatment period followed by dosing every three weeks (Q3W), with weight-based dosing adjustments. The primary endpoint across cohorts is overall response rate (ORR), assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using RECIST v1.1**.\n9\nAbout Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma\nHead and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common type of head and neck cancer, accounting for more than 90 percent of cases and approximately 4.5 percent of all cancers worldwide.\n10\nIt develops in the mucosal linings of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx.\n10\nMajor risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use, as well as infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV).\n10\nAround 75 percent of cases are HPV-negative, which is typically associated with a poorer prognosis and reduced response to treatment.\n10,11\nDespite advances in surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, many patients ultimately progress to advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease.\n4,12\nAbout RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 and RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nIn December 2025, the U.S. FDA\napproved\nRYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 (amivantamab and hyaluronidase-lpuj) across all indications of intravenous RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n(amivantamab-vmjw).\nThis subcutaneously administered therapy is also approved in Europe, Japan, China, and other markets.\nRYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme\u2019s ENHANZE\n\u00ae\ndrug delivery technology.\nThe effectiveness of RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 has been established based on adequate and well controlled studies of RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n. Data across multiple Phase 3 studies, including MARIPOSA, have demonstrated the clinical benefit of RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nin improving progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in advanced\nEGFR\n-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nRYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nis approved in the U.S., Europe and other markets across four indications in\nEGFR\n-mutated NSCLC, including two in the first-line setting and two in the second-line, for patients with either exon 19 deletions, exon 21 L858R mutations, or exon 20 insertion mutations, as monotherapy or in combination with LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n(lazertinib) or chemotherapy.\nRYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nis a first-in-class, fully-human bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and MET with immune cell-directing activity.\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network\n\u00ae\n(NCCN\n\u00ae\n) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines\n\u00ae\n)\n\u00a713\ninclude amivantamab-vmjw (RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n) across multiple treatment settings, including its recent inclusion as a NCCN Category 1 preferred option when used with lazertinib (LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n) for first-line treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations. Amivantamab and hyaluronidase-lpuj subcutaneous injection (RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122) may be substituted for IV amivantamab-vmjw (RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n). See the latest NCCN Guidelines\n\u00ae\nfor NSCLC for complete information.\n\u2020\u2021\nThe NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers also identify amivantamab-vmjw (RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n)-based regimens, including the combination with lazertinib (LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n), as the only NCCN-preferred combination options for patients with\nEGFR\n-mutated NSCLC and brain metastases.\n\u2020\u2021\nThe legal manufacturer for RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nis Janssen Biotech, Inc.

    "full_text": "New Brunswick, N.J. \u2013 FEBURARY 18, 2026\n\u2013\nJohnson & Johnson\n(NYSE: JNJ) (the \u201cCompany\u201d), healthcare\u2019s leading, most comprehensive innovation powerhouse, today announced a more than $1 billion investment in a next generation cell therapy manufacturing facility in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. This new facility will further expand the Company\u2019s U.S. manufacturing capacity as it advances its industry leading portfolio and pipeline of transformational medicines for cancer, immune-mediated and neurological diseases.\n\u201cFor 140 years,\nJohnson & Johnson\nhas been a leading innovator in American healthcare, and we are honored to continue advancing that legacy in Pennsylvania,\u201d said Joaquin Duato, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of\nJohnson & Johnson\n. \u201cBy uniting scientific excellence with state-of-the-art manufacturing and strategic investment, and by working collaboratively with our communities, we are delivering for patients and creating significant opportunities for workers and families.\u201d\nIn building this facility,\nJohnson & Johnson\ncontinues to invest in cutting-edge manufacturing processes and in training to develop a workforce skilled in advanced technologies that are shaping the future of medicine. It will support more than 500 skilled biomanufacturing jobs when fully operational and more than 4,000 construction jobs during site development.\n\u201cPennsylvania is a powerhouse for innovation and manufacturing in the life sciences,\u201d said Governor Josh Shapiro. \u201cJust a few years ago we weren\u2019t even on the field - but today we\u2019re competing and winning. We\u2019ve done it by creating the first economic development plan for Pennsylvania in 2 decades, and following through on it by cutting red tape, making strategic investments in key industries like the life sciences, and strengthening our workforce. That\u2019s why companies like\nJohnson & Johnson\nare choosing to double down on their investments here in our Commonwealth - because they know we\u2019ve got the strategy, the workforce, and the speed they need to succeed.\u201d\nDecades of Investment in Pennsylvania\nThis investment further strengthens the Company\u2019s longstanding economic impact across Pennsylvania, which totals approximately $10 billion\n1\nannually. With ten facilities encompassing more than 2 million square feet dedicated to manufacturing, research, distribution, and office operations,\nJohnson & Johnson\nmaintains one of the most significant, statewide footprints in the healthcare industry.\nThe announcement is part of the Company\u2019s previously announced $\n55 billion\nU.S. investment in manufacturing, research and development, and technology through early 2029.\nAdditional Quotes for Media Use\n\u201cPennsylvania leads in life sciences and advanced manufacturing because we consistently deliver what companies like\nJohnson & Johnson\nneed to succeed: a skilled workforce, premier research institutions, and proven manufacturing strength,\u201d said U.S. Senator Dave McCormick. \u201cThis $1 billion-plus investment in a new Lower Gwynedd facility is a testament to that leadership and will produce life-changing treatments for patients, along with new and good jobs for our Commonwealth.\u201d\n\u201cPennsylvania is a leader in health care innovation with some of the very best health care workers. Proud to see this more than $1 billion investment into Montgomery County and our Commonwealth,\u201d said\nU.S. Senator John Fetterman. \u201cBringing new jobs, advanced manufacturing, and life-saving medicine to and for our communities is always something to celebrate.\u201d\n\u201cOur region is home to world-class healthcare, science and research \u2014 and the opening of\nJohnson & Johnson\n\u2019s cell therapy manufacturing facility in Lower Gwynedd expands its long tradition of leadership in Pennsylvania,\u201d Representative Madeleine Dean said. \u201cJ&J\u2019s new site will promote job growth, foster innovation, and, most importantly, bring life-saving medicine to people around the country. I look forward to their continued success.\u201d\nABOUT JOHNSON & JOHNSON\nAt\nJohnson & Johnson\n, we believe health is everything.

    "full_text": "RARITAN, N.J., February 18, 2026\n\u2013\nJohnson & Johnson\n(NYSE:JNJ) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for subcutaneous amivantamab and hyaluronidase-lpuj as a monotherapy for the treatment of adults with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that is recurrent or metastatic and human papillomavirus (HPV)-unrelated after disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\u2122\nis approved in multiple settings for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and is also being evaluated in additional solid tumors, including colorectal cancer.\nHPV-unrelated recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by high rates of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) pathway overexpression.\n1,2,3\nSubcutaneous amivantamab is designed to target both pathways, while activating the immune system. The clinical activity observed to date supports further evaluation in this setting, where treatment options remain limited after prior lines of therapy.\n4\n\u201cPatients with HPV-unrelated recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer often face rapid disease progression and have limited treatment options,\u201d said Kiran Patel, Vice President, Global Head, Solid Tumor Clinical Development and Diagnostics,\nJohnson & Johnson\n. \u201cReceiving Breakthrough Therapy Designation underscores the FDA\u2019s recognition of these early clinical data and the urgent need for new therapies. Dual targeting EGFR\nand MET has shown meaningful clinical benefit in lung cancer, helping patients live longer by changing disease biology and preventing treatment resistance. We are now applying this same multi-targeted approach in head and neck cancer with the goal of improving outcomes for patients.\u201d\nThe BTD is supported by data from the open\u2011label Phase 1b/2 OrigAMI\u20114 study. Results were\npresented\nin a mini-oral session at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress and demonstrate promising clinical activity, with rapid and durable responses, in a heavily pretreated patient population.\n5\nBased on these findings, subcutaneous amivantamab is being further evaluated in the ongoing Phase 3 OrigAMI-5 study (\nNCT07276399\n), which is assessing the subcutaneous formulation of amivantamab in combination with pembrolizumab and carboplatin versus 5-fluorouracil (5FU) plus pembrolizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) as a first-line treatment in patients with HPV-unrelated recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, regardless of PD-L1 expression.\n6\nThe FDA grants BTD to expedite the development and regulatory review of investigational medicines intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions, where preliminary clinical evidence indicates the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over available treatment options on at least one clinically meaningful endpoint.\n7\nAbout the OrigAMI-4 Study\nOrigAMI-4 (\nNCT06385080\n) is an open-label Phase 1b/2 study evaluating RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\u2122\nin recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). The study includes five cohorts, including Cohort 1, which studied RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\u2122\nas monotherapy in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-unrelated R/M HNSCC who had received prior platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Patients with prior anti-\nEGFR\ntherapy were excluded. RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\u2122\nwas administered every three weeks (Q3W) at 2400 mg, or 3360 mg for patients weighing 80 kg or more. The primary endpoint is overall response rate (ORR) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) using RECIST v1.1**\n.8\nAbout Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma\nHead and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common type of head and neck cancer, accounting for more than 90 percent of cases and approximately 4.5 percent of all cancers worldwide.\n9\nIt develops in the mucosal linings of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx.\n9\nMajor risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use, as well as infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV).9 Around 75 percent of cases are HPV-negative, which is typically associated with a poorer prognosis and reduced response to treatment.\n9,10\nDespite advances in surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, many patients ultimately progress to advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease.\n1,4\nAbout RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 and RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nIn December 2025, the U.S. FDA\napproved\nRYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 (amivantamab and hyaluronidase-lpuj) across all indications of intravenous RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n(amivantamab-vmjw). This subcutaneously administered therapy is also approved in Europe, Japan, China, and other markets.\nRYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme\u2019s ENHANZE\n\u00ae\ndrug delivery technology.\nThe effectiveness of RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 has been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n. Data across multiple Phase 3 studies, including MARIPOSA, have demonstrated the clinical benefit of RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nin improving progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in advanced\nEGFR\n-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nRYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nis approved in the U.S., Europe and other markets across four indications in\nEGFR\n-mutated NSCLC, including two in the first-line setting and two in the second line, for patients with either exon 19 deletions, exon 21 L858R mutations, or exon 20 insertion mutations, as monotherapy or in combination with LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n(lazertinib) or chemotherapy.\nRYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nis a first-in-class, fully-human bispecific antibody targeting\nEGFR\nand MET with immune cell-directing activity.\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network\n\u00ae\n(NCCN\n\u00ae\n) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines\n\u00ae\n)\n\u00a711\ninclude amivantamab-vmjw (RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n) across multiple treatment settings, including its recent inclusion as a NCCN Category 1 preferred option when used with lazertinib (LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n) for first-line treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with\nEGFR\nexon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations. Amivantamab and hyaluronidase-lpuj subcutaneous injection (RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122) may be substituted for IV amivantamab-vmjw (RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n). See the latest NCCN Guidelines\n\u00ae\nfor NSCLC for complete information.\n\u2020\u2021\nThe NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers also identify amivantamab-vmjw (RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n)-based regimens, including the combination with lazertinib (LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n), as the only NCCN-preferred combination options for patients with\nEGFR\n-mutated NSCLC and brain metastases.\n\u2020\u2021\nThe legal manufacturer for RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nis Janssen Biotech, Inc.

    "full_text": "HORSHAM, P.A. (February 17, 2026)\n\u2013\nJohnson & Johnson\n(NYSE: JNJ) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a new, simplified monthly dosing schedule* for RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 (amivantamab and hyaluronidase-lpuj). When administered in combination with oral LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n(lazertinib) for the first-line treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), monthly dosing delivers consistent outcomes with the previously approved bi-weekly subcutaneous (SC) dosing schedule.\n1,2\nThis milestone builds upon the\nrecent FDA approval\nof RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122, which transformed administration time from hours to minutes and offers a fivefold reduction in administration-related reactions (ARRs), when compared to intravenous (IV) delivery. With this newly approved monthly dosing schedule, patients are able to transition to monthly dosing as early as Week 5. Together, these advances build on an unmatched survival benefit while supporting continued treatment optimization, further simplifying care delivery and offering greater convenience.\n1\n\u201cA monthly dosing schedule offers patients convenience without sacrificing efficacy,\u201d said Danny Nguyen, M.D., Assistant Clinical Professor, Department of Medical Oncology & Therapeutics Research, City of Hope, and principal investigator for the PALOMA-3 and MARIPOSA studies.** \u201cWith a flexible schedule that reduces time in the clinic, patients may be able to stay on therapy longer and free up time to focus on the moments that matter most.\u201d\nRecently presented at the 2025 World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC), PALOMA-2 data demonstrated that monthly RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 dosing in combination with LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\ndelivered a high objective response rate (ORR) in previously untreated, EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC. The study showed significant reduction in ARRs compared to historical IV administration and consistent rates with bi-weekly SC delivery.\n2\n\u201cThis latest milestone represents the culmination of our unwavering efforts and commitment to fundamentally redefine the way we treat patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer,\u201d said Mahadi Baig, M.D., M.H.C.M., Vice President, U.S. Medical Affairs,\nJohnson & Johnson\n. \u201cBuilding on unmatched overall survival and regimens that support proactive side effect management, this once-monthly injection now delivers the simplest and fastest combination therapy for patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.\u201d\nThe safety profile of monthly dosing of RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 is comparable when it is administered every two weeks. Consistent with IV and SC administration, most adverse events were related to EGFR/MET inhibition. ARRs were consistent with the bi-weekly dosing schedule (12% vs 13% respectively) and fivefold lower when compared to historical IV administration (66%). Similarly, venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) were consistent with bi-weekly SC administration (13% vs 11% with anticoagulation) and lower than historic IV data without anticoagulation (38%).\n1,2\nNo new safety signals were identified. Only 8% of patients discontinued amivantamab due to treatment-related adverse events. The mean plasma concentration levels were consistent with historical IV and bi-weekly SC dosing data, supporting pharmacokinetic comparability.\n2\n###\nAccess to RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122\nJohnson & Johnson\noffers comprehensive access and support information and resources to assist patients in gaining access to RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122.

The primary endpoint was ORR as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1.\n2,7\nPALOMA-2 Cohort 5 evaluated the efficacy, PK, and safety of first-line SC amivantamab Q4W plus LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\nin EGFR-mutated NSCLC.\nAbout the MARIPOSA Study\nMARIPOSA (\nNCT04487080\n), which enrolled 1,074 patients, is a randomized, Phase 3 study evaluating RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n(amivantamab-vmjw) plus LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\nversus osimertinib and versus LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\nalone in first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR ex19del or substitution mutations.\nThe primary endpoint of the study is PFS (using RECIST v1.1 guidelines) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), ORR, duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival after first subsequent therapy (PFS2) and intracranial PFS.\n8\nResistance to third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as osimertinib (when given alone or with chemotherapy), remains a major barrier to long-term disease control.\n9\nThe combination regimen RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nplus LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\nuses a multitargeted mechanism of action: targeting EGFR mutations from two angles, blocking MET, and engaging the immune system.\n10\nThis approach has the potential to change the natural history of the disease by reducing the spectrum and complexity of acquired resistance mechanisms.\n11\nAn analysis from MARIPOSA, presented at the\nInternational Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2025 World Congress on Lung Cancer (WCLC)\n, demonstrated that the combination\nsignificantly reduced the development of\nEGFR\n- and MET-driven resistance compared with osimertinib in the first-line setting. MET amplifications occurred in three percent of patients on the combination vs 13 percent on osimertinib (\nP\n=0.002), and secondary\nEGFR\nmutations (such as C797S) were significantly lower for RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nplus LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n(1 percent vs 8 percent;\nP\n=0.01). Notably, acquired MET amplification led to early discontinuation in 23 percent of patients on osimertinib within six months, compared with four percent on RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nplus LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n.\n12,13\nAbout RYBREVANT FASPRO\u2122 and RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nIn December 2025, the U.S. FDA\napproved\nRYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 (amivantamab and hyaluronidase-lpuj) across all indications of intravenous RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n(amivantamab-vmjw).\nThis subcutaneously administered therapy is also approved in Europe, Japan, China, and other markets.\nRYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20), Halozyme\u2019s ENHANZE\n\u00ae\ndrug delivery technology.\nThe effectiveness of RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 has been established based on adequate and well controlled studies of RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n. Data across multiple Phase 3 studies, including MARIPOSA, have demonstrated the clinical benefit of RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nin improving PFS and OS in advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC.\nRYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nis approved in the U.S., Europe and other markets across four indications in EGFR-mutated NSCLC, including two in the first-line setting and two in the second-line, for patients with either exon 19 deletions, exon 21 L858R mutations, or exon 20 insertion mutations, as monotherapy or in combination with LAZCLUZE (lazertinib) or chemotherapy.\nRYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nis a first-in-class, fully-human bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and MET with immune cell-directing activity.\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network\n\u00ae\n(NCCN\n\u00ae\n) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines\n\u00ae\n)\n\u2021i\ninclude amivantamab-vmjw (RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n) across multiple treatment settings, including its recent inclusion as a NCCN Category 1 preferred option when used with lazertinib (LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n) for first-line treatment of people with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations. Amivantamab and hyaluronidase-lpuj subcutaneous injection (RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122) may be substituted for IV amivantamab-vmjw (RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n). See the latest NCCN Guidelines\n\u00ae\nfor NSCLC for complete information.\n\u00a7\u2016\nThe NCCN Guidelines for Central Nervous System Cancers also identify amivantamab-vmjw (RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n)-based regimens, including the combination with lazertinib (LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n), as the only NCCN-preferred combination options for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC and brain metastases.\n\u00a7\u2016\nThe legal manufacturer for RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\nis Janssen Biotech, Inc. For more information, visit www.RYBREVANT.com.\nAbout LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\nIn 2018, Janssen Biotech, Inc., entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Yuhan Corporation for the development of LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n(marketed as LECLAZA in South Korea). LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\nis an oral, third-generation, brain-penetrant EGFR TKI that targets both the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing wild-type EGFR. An analysis of the efficacy and safety of LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\nfrom the Phase 3 LASER301 study was published in\nThe Journal of Clinical Oncology\nin 2023.\nAbout Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)\nWorldwide, lung cancer is one of the most common cancers, with NSCLC making up 80 to 85 percent of all lung cancer cases.\n14,15\nThe main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.\n15\nAmong the most common driver mutations in NSCLC are alterations in EGFR, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase controlling cell growth and division.\n16\nEGFR mutations are present in 10 to 15 percent of Western patients with NSCLC with adenocarcinoma histology and occur in 40 to 50 percent of Asian patients.\n16-19\nEGFR exon 19 deletions or EGFR L858R mutations are the most common EGFR mutations.\n20,21\nThe five-year survival rate for all people with advanced NSCLC and EGFR mutations treated with EGFR TKIs is less than 20 percent.\n22\nEGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are the third most prevalent activating EGFR mutation.\n23\nPatients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations have a real-world five-year OS of eight percent in the frontline setting, which is worse than patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations, who have a real-world five-year OS of 19 percent.\n21\nAbout EGFR Mutations\nEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are among the most common oncogenic drivers in NSCLC, especially in younger individuals and those who have never smoked.\nThese mutations promote uncontrolled cell growth and are linked to poor outcomes.\n19\nDespite progress with targeted therapies, including third-generation EGFR TKI, long-term survival remains limited, with five-year survival rates below 20 percent.\n22\nOvercoming resistance mechanisms, such as MET amplification and secondary EGFR mutations, is essential for improving outcomes and extending survival in EGFR-mutated NSCLC.\n12\nINDICATIONS\nRYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 (amivantamab and hyaluronidase-lpuj) and RYBREVANT\n\u00ae\n(amivantamab-vmjw) are indicated:\nin combination with LAZCLUZE\n\u00ae\n(lazertinib) for the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon\u202f19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test.\nin combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations, whose disease has progressed on or after treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\nin combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed for the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, as detected by an FDA-approved test.\nas a single agent for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, as detected by an FDA approved test, whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n1\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nRYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to hyaluronidase or to any of its excipients.\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nHypersensitivity and Administration-Related Reactions with RYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122\nRYBREVANT\nFASPRO\n\u2122 can cause hypersensitivity and administration-related reactions (ARRs); signs and symptoms of ARR include dyspnea, flushing, fever, chills, chest discomfort, hypotension, and vomiting.

Initial results for 12-month outcomes across the 30-patient pilot cohort show investigators achieved 100% acute procedural success with no procedure-associated adverse events, while 56.7% of cases were performed with zero fluoroscopy and 90% of patients achieved primary effectiveness at 12 months.\ni\nOMNY-AF is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center clinical trial conducted across more than 40 sites in the U.S. and Australia.\ni\nThe study pairs the OMNYPULSE Catheter, a 12 mm large-tip focal catheter featuring contact-force sensing and bipolar, biphasic pulse delivery with the TRUPULSE Generator. This integrated design combines precise mapping, controlled energy delivery and live feedback through the PF index on the CARTO 3 System.\nii\nThe OMNYPULSE Platform is not currently approved in any region of the world.\n\u201cThe 12-month data provide encouraging early evidence on the OMNY-AF study with promising safety outcomes \u2013 no procedure-related adverse events or MRI-detected cerebral lesions \u2013 across eight centers in the pilot phase\ni\n. In my cases during the ongoing OMNY-AF trial, the seamless integration of advanced mapping, ultrasound, and PF Index with contact force were valuable for precise and efficient pulsed field energy delivery,\u201d said Dinesh Sharma, M.D.\n1\n, Section Head of Cardiac Electrophysiology at the Naples Heart Institute, the study presenting author.\nAlongside the OMNY-AF data,\nJohnson & Johnson\nis highlighting new findings related to the VARIPULSE Platform. Data presented by Andrea Natale, M.D.\n2\n, and simultaneously published in\nJACC Clinical Electrophysiology\n,\nby Moussa Mansour, M.D.\n3\nexamined the incidence of neurovascular events following the workflow enhancements and the introduction of an optimized irrigation flow rate. Notably, the platform sustained a low neurovascular event rate of 0.22% in 6,811 patients after implementation of both workflow enhancements and the updated irrigation rate.\nii\nAdditional VARIPULSE Platform data presented at AF Symposium adds to the growing body of evidence underscoring the platform\u2019s consistent and favorable safety profile across a range of clinical and real-world settings, including:\nVARISURE Safety survey data presented by Christopher Porterfield, M.D.\n4\n: Early results from this physician survey on 850 procedures indicated low complication rates with a 1.9% rate of primary adverse events, a 0.2% incidence of neurovascular events and no reported cases of coronary spasm or death. Same-day discharge was achieved in 87.9% of patients.\niii\nREAL AF registry analysis presented by Mohammad-Ali Jazayeri, M.D.\n5\n: Results from the REAL AF registry showed excellent acute safety outcomes of the VARIPULSE Catheter, with a low overall acute safety event rate of 0.5% with no neurovascular events, high rates of same-day discharge and no observed differences in safety outcomes across AFib classifications.\niv\nIrrigation Flow Optimization research presented by Fengwei Zou, M.D.\n6\n: Preclinical data demonstrated parity between the 4 mL/min and 30 mL/min irrigation rates in microbubble generation, hemolysis and lesion depth when using the VARIPULSE Catheter, while confirming that higher irrigation significantly reduced electrode surface heating.\nv\n\u201cThese data reinforce confidence in the consistency of safety outcomes observed across\nJohnson & Johnson\n\u2019s electrophysiology portfolio. As a relatively new energy modality, pulse field ablation technologies should be individually evaluated for safety and reproducibility in atrial fibrillation ablation,\u201d said Gregory Michaud, M.D., Chief Medical and Scientific Officer, Electrophysiology, MedTech,\nJohnson & Johnson\n. \u201cAs pulsed field ablation continues to evolve, rigorous evidence generation and transparent data sharing will be essential to advancing the science and enabling the next wave of innovation with this technology.\u201d\nJohnson & Johnson\nremains committed to evidence-driven innovation that advances patient care and informs clinical decision-making across its electrophysiology portfolio. These efforts are supported by the CARTO 3 System, the world\u2019s leading cardiac mapping system\n7\n.\nAbout The OMNY-AF Study\nThe OMNY-AF study is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center study evaluating the clinical safety and effectiveness of the OMNYPULSE Catheter for the treatment of symptomatic paroxysmal AFib. Up to 440 enrolled subjects will undergo an ablation procedure with the OMNYPULSE Platform. The primary safety endpoint in the study is the occurrence of Primary Adverse Events within seven days of the ablation procedure. The primary effectiveness endpoint is freedom from documented (symptomatic and asymptomatic) atrial tachyarrhythmia episodes based on electrocardiographic data and additional failure modes during the effectiveness evaluation period over a 12-month period.\nAbout the VARIPULSE Platform\nThe VARIPULSE Platform is\nJohnson & Johnson\nMedTech\u2019s Pulsed Field ablation system. The fully integrated platform includes the VARIPULSE Catheter, TRUPULSE Generator, and CARTO 3 Mapping System VARIPULSE Software. The Platform is now approved for use in the United States, Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada, and Latin America.\nCardiovascular Solutions from\nJohnson & Johnson\nMedTech\nAcross\nJohnson & Johnson\n, we are tackling the world\u2019s most complex and pervasive health challenges.

    "full_text": "Merck Announces Positive New Data for ENFLONSIA\u2122 (clesrovimab) for Infants and Children Under 2 Years of Age at Increased Risk for Severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Disease Over Two RSV Seasons\nSave\nFebruary 19, 2026 5:15 am EST\nSecond season results from the Phase 3 SMART trial were presented at the 9\nth\nRSVVW Conference and will be shared with the U.S. FDA and other regulatory authorities\nRAHWAY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nMerck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, today announced positive second RSV season findings from the Phase 3 SMART trial (MK-1654-007) (\nNCT04938830\n) evaluating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ENFLONSIA\u2122 (clesrovimab) in infants and children at increased risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease over two RSV seasons. The data were presented during an oral session (Abstract #P455) at RSVVW\u201926, the 9\nth\nconference of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Foundation (ReSViNET) in Rome, Italy.\nNew data from the SMART trial in children under 2 years of age who remained at increased risk for severe RSV disease through their second RSV season and received ENFLONSIA at the start of RSV season 2 showed that safety was generally consistent with safety observed in MK-1654-007 infants who received ENFLONSIA during RSV season 1. Additional safety data can be found below. Additionally, the monoclonal antibody (mAb) serum concentrations achieved in children under 2 years of age at increased risk for severe RSV disease through their second RSV season (secondary endpoint) were similar to those in healthy infants in the pivotal Phase 2b/3 CLEVER trial (MK-1654-004) (\nNCT04767373\n). Results from the SMART study support extrapolation of efficacy to children under 2 years of age at increased risk for severe RSV disease through RSV season 2.\n\u201cAll children who received ENFLONSIA in their second RSV season were at increased risk for severe RSV disease, and nearly all had chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease,\u201d said Dr. Paolo Manzoni, Head of Maternal\u2013Infant Medicine, University of Torino Hospital Degli Infermi, Ponderano, Italy, and an investigator for the SMART clinical trial. \u201cThese new findings from SMART demonstrate the potential of ENFLONSIA to help protect these vulnerable children, who may require an additional dose for their second RSV season.\u201d\nInterim data from RSV season 1 of the Phase 3 SMART trial \u2014 alongside data from the pivotal Phase 2b/3 CLEVER trial\u2014supported the\nFDA approval\nof ENFLONSIA in June 2025 and subsequent global regulatory approvals. Interim data from RSV season 1 of the SMART trial were also presented at\nIDWeek 2024\nand published in the\nNew England Journal of Medicine\n. The SMART trial enrolled infants at increased risk of severe RSV disease due to prematurity (<29 weeks through \u226435 weeks gestational age), chronic lung disease of prematurity or hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease entering their first RSV season.\n\u201cRSV is among the leading causes of infant hospitalization globally and is especially serious for children under 2 years of age at high risk for severe disease,\u201d said Dr. Macaya Douoguih, vice president, Therapeutic Area Head, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cThese new data from the SMART study further position ENFLONSIA as an important potential new option to help protect young children who remain at high risk entering their second RSV season. We aspire to bring ENFLONSIA to all eligible infants and high-risk children under 2 years of age around the world and look forward to sharing these encouraging data with global regulatory authorities to help achieve this goal.\u201d\nThe second season results will be shared with the FDA and global regulatory authorities for evaluation for an expanded indication in children at increased risk for severe RSV disease through their second RSV season. ENFLONSIA is currently approved in the United States, Canada and several other countries for use in infants during their first RSV season, and regulatory filings are underway in additional markets globally.\nENFLONSIA is a preventive, long-acting mAb designed to provide direct, rapid and durable protection through 5 months, a typical RSV season, with the same dose regardless of infant weight.\nAbout ENFLONSIA\u2122 (clesrovimab-cfor) in the U.S.\nENFLONSIA is Merck\u2019s\nFDA-approved\nextended half-life monoclonal antibody (mAb) indicated for passive immunization for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants who are born during or entering their first RSV season. ENFLONSIA is administered using the same dose regardless of weight (105 mg/0.7 mL in a prefilled syringe) and is designed to provide direct, rapid and durable protection through 5 months, a typical RSV season. For infants born during the RSV season, ENFLONSIA is to be administered within the first week of life. For infants born outside of the RSV season, ENFLONSIA should be administered shortly before the RSV season begins. For infants undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass during or entering their first RSV season, an additional 105 mg dose is recommended as soon as the infant is stable after surgery. ENFLONSIA has a 30-month shelf life.\nSelected Safety Information for ENFLONSIA\u2122 (clesrovimab-cfor) in the U.S.\nDo not administer ENFLONSIA to infants with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to any component of ENFLONSIA.\nSerious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been observed with other human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibodies. If signs or symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive therapy.\nENFLONSIA may interfere with some immunologically-based RSV diagnostic assays (i.e., rapid antigen tests) as observed in laboratory studies. Confirmation using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is recommended when rapid antigen assay results are negative and clinical observations are consistent with RSV infection.\nThe most common adverse reactions were injection-site erythema (3.8%), injection-site swelling (2.7%) and rash (2.3%).\nAbout the Phase 3 SMART Trial Findings Evaluating ENFLONSIA\u2122 (clesrovimab) Presented at RSVVW\u201926\nThe SMART trial (MK-1654-007) (\nNCT04938830\n) was a Phase 3, randomized, partially-blind, palivizumab-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ENFLONSIA in infants and children at increased risk for severe RSV disease over two RSV seasons. The trial enrolled early (<29 weeks gestational age [GA]) or moderate preterm infants (\u226529 to \u226435 weeks GA) and infants with chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity or congenital heart disease (CHD) of any GA.\nIn RSV season 1, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either a 105 mg dose of ENFLONSIA (n=502) or monthly palivizumab (n=501) by intramuscular (IM) injection. In RSV season 2, eligible participants (children under 2 years of age with CLD, CHD or early or moderate preterm birth with certain risk conditions) received an additional open-label 210 mg dose of ENFLONSIA by IM injection administered as two 105 mg injections (n=276, of whom 138 received ENFLONSIA and 138 received palivizumab in RSV season 1). Nearly all participants (99%) who received ENFLONSIA in RSV season 2 had CLD (n=229) or CHD (n=43).\nRSV Season 1 Findings\nData from the completed SMART trial demonstrate that, among infants at increased risk for severe RSV disease entering their first RSV season, the safety profile of ENFLONSIA was similar to palivizumab and consistent with the safety profile of ENFLONSIA in infants in the pivotal Phase 2b/3 CLEVER trial (MK-1654-004) (\nNCT04767373\n).\nThe proportions of participants with adverse events (AEs) were generally comparable between study groups. The solicited AEs reported days 1-5 following any dose included irritability (28.8% ENFLONSIA arm; 33.7% palivizumab arm); somnolence (18.9%; 22.0%); decreased appetite (13.5%; 13.2%); injection site pain (7.8%; 10.8%); injection site erythema (6.2%; 6.4%); injection site swelling (6.2%; 5.6%); and fever (0.8%; 1.2%). No drug-related serious AEs (SAEs) were reported for ENFLONSIA.\nThe efficacy of ENFLONSIA in infants at increased risk for severe RSV disease entering their first RSV season was established by extrapolation of efficacy of ENFLONSIA from the CLEVER trial to the SMART trial based on pharmacokinetic exposure, a secondary endpoint. The incidence rates of RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory infection (MALRI)\u2014characterized as cough or difficulty breathing and requiring \u22651 indicator of LRI (wheezing, rales/crackles) or severity (chest wall in-drawing/retractions, hypoxemia, tachypnoea, dehydration due to respiratory symptoms)\u2014and RSV-associated hospitalization were generally comparable between ENFLONSIA (3.2%, 95% CI: 1.8, 5.2 and 1.0%, 95% CI: 0.3, 2.4, respectively) and palivizumab (3.4%, 95% CI: 2.0, 5.6 and 1.7%, 95% CI: 0.7, 3.3, respectively) through Day 150 (5 months).\nRSV Season 2 Findings\nAll participants in RSV season 2 received open-label ENFLONSIA. The proportions of participants experiencing AEs during RSV season 2 were generally comparable between those who had received either ENFLONSIA (105 mg) or palivizumab in season 1. In children under 2 years of age who remained at increased risk for severe RSV disease through their second RSV season and received ENFLONSIA at the start of RSV season 2, safety was generally consistent with safety observed in MK-1654-007 infants who received ENFLONSIA during RSV season 1. The solicited AEs reported days 1-5 post-dose included irritability (13.0%); somnolence (8.7%); decreased appetite (6.9%); injection site pain (4.3%); injection site erythema (1.8%); injection site swelling (1.8%); and fever (1.1%). No drug-related SAEs were reported.\nThe monoclonal antibody serum concentrations achieved in children under 2 years of age at increased risk for severe RSV disease through their second RSV season (secondary endpoint) were similar to those in healthy infants in the CLEVER trial. Results from SMART support extrapolation of efficacy to children under 2 years of age at increased risk for severe RSV disease through RSV season 2. Among children who received ENFLONSIA in RSV season 2, the incidence rates of RSV-associated MALRI requiring \u22651 indicator of LRI or severity and RSV-associated hospitalization were 7.3% (95% CI: 4.4, 11.4) and 3.0% (95% CI: 1.3, 5.9), respectively, through Day 180 (6 months), reflecting these children\u2019s higher baseline risk as well as the RSV disease burden post-COVID pandemic.\nAbout RSV Globally\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a contagious virus that causes widespread seasonal infections and can lead to serious respiratory conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. As a leading cause of hospitalization among infants globally, there is persisting unmet need for RSV preventive options for both healthy and high-risk infants during their first RSV season as well as for children at increased risk for severe RSV disease through their second RSV season. RSV season is the time of year when RSV infections are most common, usually occurring autumn through spring of the next year in temperate climates. Timing and severity in a given community or region can vary year to year.\nAbout Merck\nAt Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, we are unified around our purpose: We use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.

Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers, Merck is evaluating our portfolio of medicines and pipeline candidates in earlier disease states, with more than 30 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.\nAbout Merck\u2019s research in genitourinary cancers\nMerck is advancing research aimed at helping transform the treatment landscape and broaden options for people with genitourinary (GU) cancers, including bladder, kidney and prostate cancers. Globally, GU cancers account for an estimated 2.6 million new cancer diagnoses each year, equaling over 1 in 8 of all cancer incidences. Through a robust clinical development program with more than 50 clinical trials evaluating more than 22,000 patients around the world, Merck is investigating the potential of several portfolio medicines and pipeline assets, leveraging multiple novel combination strategies, across various stages of disease, to help address unmet needs in GU cancers.\nAbout KEYTRUDA\n\u00ae\n(pembrolizumab) injection for intravenous use, 100 mg\nKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body\u2019s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.\nMerck has the industry\u2019s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.\nSelected KEYTRUDA\n\u00ae\n(pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.\nUrothelial Cancer\nKEYTRUDA, in combination with enfortumab vedotin, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.\nKEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma:\nwho are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy, or\nwho have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.\nKEYTRUDA, in combination with enfortumab vedotin, as neoadjuvant treatment and then continued after cystectomy as adjuvant treatment, is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.\nKEYTRUDA, as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy.\nRenal Cell Carcinoma\nKEYTRUDA, in combination with axitinib, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).\nKEYTRUDA, in combination with lenvatinib, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC.\nKEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with RCC at intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence following nephrectomy, or following nephrectomy and resection of metastatic lesions.\nSee additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.\nSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA\nSevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\nKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.\nMonitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.\nPneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.\nPneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.\nHepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis\nKEYTRUDA as a Single Agent\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.\nKEYTRUDA With Axitinib\nKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT \u22653 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\nAdrenal Insufficiency\nKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\nHypophysitis\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\nThyroid Disorders\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in <0.1% (1) of patients.\nHyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.\nType 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Which Can Present With Diabetic Ketoacidosis\nMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in <0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\nImmune-Mediated Nephritis With Renal Dysfunction\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.\nImmune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate nonexfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients.\nOther Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\nThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions.\nCardiac/Vascular:\nMyocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis;\nNervous System:\nMeningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy;\nOcular:\nUveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss;\nGastrointestinal:\nPancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis;\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue:\nMyositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica;\nEndocrine:\nHypoparathyroidism;\nHematologic/Immune:\nHemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.\nInfusion-Related Reactions\nKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.\nComplications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\nIncreased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma\nIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.\nEmbryofetal Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.\nAdverse Reactions\nIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (28%), diarrhea (26%), rash (24%), and nausea (21%).\nIn KEYNOTE-054, when KEYTRUDA was administered as a single agent to patients with stage III melanoma, KEYTRUDA was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 14% of 509 patients; the most common (\u22651%) were pneumonitis (1.4%), colitis (1.2%), and diarrhea (1%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most common adverse reaction (\u226520%) with KEYTRUDA was diarrhea (28%). In KEYNOTE-716, when KEYTRUDA was administered as a single agent to patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma, adverse reactions occurring in patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma were similar to those occurring in 1011 patients with stage III melanoma from KEYNOTE-054.\nIn KEYNOTE-189, when KEYTRUDA was administered with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy in metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 20% of 405 patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were pneumonitis (3%) and acute kidney injury (2%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) with KEYTRUDA were nausea (56%), fatigue (56%), constipation (35%), diarrhea (31%), decreased appetite (28%), rash (25%), vomiting (24%), cough (21%), dyspnea (21%), and pyrexia (20%).\nIn KEYNOTE-407, when KEYTRUDA was administered with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound in metastatic squamous NSCLC, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 15% of 101 patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. Adverse reactions observed in KEYNOTE-407 were similar to those observed in KEYNOTE-189 with the exception that increased incidences of alopecia (47% vs 36%) and peripheral neuropathy (31% vs 25%) were observed in the KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy arm compared to the placebo and chemotherapy arm in KEYNOTE-407.\nIn KEYNOTE-042, KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 19% of 636 patients with advanced NSCLC; the most common were pneumonitis (3%), death due to unknown cause (1.6%), and pneumonia (1.4%).

LENVIMA inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1-4, the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1), KIT, and RET. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, LENVIMA decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone. The combination of LENVIMA and everolimus showed increased antiangiogenic and antitumor activity as demonstrated by decreased human endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, and VEGF signaling in vitro and tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of human renal cell cancer greater than each drug alone.\nLENVIMA\n\u00ae\n(lenvatinib) Indications in the U.S.\nFor the treatment of adult patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).\nIn combination with pembrolizumab, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).\nIn combination with everolimus, for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy.\nFor the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\nIn combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) or not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.\nSelected Safety Information for LENVIMA\nWarnings and Precautions\nHypertension.\nIn differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), hypertension occurred in 73% of patients on LENVIMA (44% grade 3-4).

Fatal events, including hepatic failure, acute hepatitis and hepatorenal syndrome, occurred in 0.5% of patients. In HCC, hepatic encephalopathy occurred in 8% of LENVIMA-treated patients (5% grade 3-5). Grade 3-5 hepatic failure occurred in 3% of LENVIMA-treated patients. 2% of patients discontinued LENVIMA due to hepatic encephalopathy and 1% discontinued due to hepatic failure.\nMonitor liver function prior to initiation, then every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, and at least monthly thereafter during treatment. Monitor patients with HCC closely for signs of hepatic failure, including hepatic encephalopathy. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.\nRenal Failure or Impairment.\nSerious including fatal renal failure or impairment can occur with LENVIMA. Renal impairment was reported in 14% and 7% of LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, respectively. Grade 3-5 renal failure or impairment occurred in 3% of patients with DTC and 2% of patients with HCC, including 1 fatal event in each study.

Monitor for proteinuria prior to initiation and periodically during treatment. If urine dipstick proteinuria \u22652+ is detected, obtain a 24-hour urine protein. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.\nDiarrhea.\nOf the 737 LENVIMA-treated patients in DTC and HCC, diarrhea occurred in 49% (6% grade 3). In RCC, diarrhea occurred in 81% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients (19% grade 3). Diarrhea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction, and diarrhea recurred despite dose reduction. Promptly initiate management of diarrhea. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.\nFistula Formation and Gastrointestinal Perforation.\nOf the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA or LENVIMA + everolimus in DTC, RCC, and HCC, fistula or gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 2%. Permanently discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation of any severity or grade 3-4 fistula.\nQT Interval Prolongation.\nIn DTC, QT/QTc interval prolongation occurred in 9% of LENVIMA-treated patients and QT interval prolongation of >500 ms occurred in 2%.

In RCC, grade 3-4 hypocalcemia occurred in 6% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients. In HCC, grade 3 hypocalcemia occurred in 0.8% of LENVIMA-treated patients. Monitor blood calcium levels at least monthly and replace calcium as necessary during treatment. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity.\nReversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS).\nAcross clinical studies of 1,823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, RPLS occurred in 0.3%. Confirm diagnosis of RPLS with MRI. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue depending on severity and persistence of neurologic symptoms.\nHemorrhagic Events.\nSerious including fatal hemorrhagic events can occur with LENVIMA. In DTC, RCC, and HCC clinical trials, hemorrhagic events, of any grade, occurred in 29% of the 799 patients treated with LENVIMA as a single agent or in combination with everolimus. The most frequently reported hemorrhagic events (all grades and occurring in at least 5% of patients) were epistaxis and hematuria. In DTC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 2% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 1 fatal intracranial hemorrhage among 16 patients who received LENVIMA and had CNS metastases at baseline. In RCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 8% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients, including 1 fatal cerebral hemorrhage. In HCC, grade 3-5 hemorrhage occurred in 5% of LENVIMA-treated patients, including 7 fatal hemorrhagic events. Serious tumor-related bleeds, including fatal hemorrhagic events, occurred in LENVIMA-treated patients in clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting. In postmarketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery hemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than other tumors. Safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in patients with ATC have not been demonstrated in clinical trials.\nConsider the risk of severe or fatal hemorrhage associated with tumor invasion or infiltration of major blood vessels (eg, carotid artery). Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon recovery or permanently discontinue based on severity.\nImpairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression/Thyroid Dysfunction.\nLENVIMA impairs exogenous thyroid suppression. In DTC, 88% of patients had baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level \u22640.5 mU/L. In patients with normal TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH level >0.5 mU/L was observed post baseline in 57% of LENVIMA-treated patients. In RCC and HCC, grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients and 21% of LENVIMA-treated patients, respectively. In patients with normal or low TSH at baseline, elevation of TSH was observed post baseline in 70% of LENVIMA-treated patients in HCC and 60% of LENVIMA + everolimus\u2013treated patients in RCC.\nMonitor thyroid function prior to initiation and at least monthly during treatment. Treat hypothyroidism according to standard medical practice.\nImpaired Wound Healing.\nImpaired wound healing has been reported in patients who received LENVIMA. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of LENVIMA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established.\nOsteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ).\nONJ has been reported in patients receiving LENVIMA. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, dental disease or invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ.\nPerform an oral examination prior to treatment with LENVIMA and periodically during LENVIMA treatment. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices and to consider having preventive dentistry performed prior to treatment with LENVIMA and throughout treatment with LENVIMA.\nAvoid invasive dental procedures, if possible, while on LENVIMA treatment, particularly in patients at higher risk. Withhold LENVIMA for at least 1 week prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ.\nWithhold LENVIMA if ONJ develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution.\nEmbryo\u2010Fetal Toxicity.\nBased on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of LENVIMA during organogenesis at doses below the recommended clinical doses resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus; and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose.\nAdverse Reactions\nIn DTC, the most common adverse reactions (\u226530%) observed in LENVIMA-treated patients were hypertension (73%), fatigue (67%), diarrhea (67%), arthralgia/myalgia (62%), decreased appetite (54%), decreased weight (51%), nausea (47%), stomatitis (41%), headache (38%), vomiting (36%), proteinuria (34%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (32%), abdominal pain (31%), and dysphonia (31%).

Results from the trial showed that KEYTRUDA plus paclitaxel, with or without bevacizumab, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 28% (HR=0.72 [95% CI, 0.58-0.89]; p=0.0014) in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS \u22651) when compared to placebo plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab. In this same population, the KEYTRUDA regimen also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS), reducing the risk of death by 24% (HR=0.76 [95% CI, 0.61-0.94]; p=0.0053) compared to placebo plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab. The effectiveness of KEYTRUDA QLEX for its approved indications has been established based upon evidence from the adequate and well-controlled studies conducted with KEYTRUDA and additional data from MK-3475A-D77 comparing the pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety profiles of KEYTRUDA QLEX and KEYTRUDA.\n\u201cFor many patients with ovarian cancer, the disease can become platinum-resistant, at which point recurrence is not just a setback \u2014 it\u2019s when options can become limited, and the reality patients face can change very quickly,\u201d said Dr. Bradley Monk, gynecologic oncologist and medical director of the Late-Stage Clinical Research Program at Florida Cancer Specialists and Research Institute. \u201cFor patients who have been previously treated with standard platinum-based therapies, the FDA approvals of these pembrolizumab-based regimens offer the possibility of more time.\u201d\nKEYTRUDA QLEX is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to berahyaluronidase alfa, hyaluronidase or to any of its excipients. KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are associated with the following Warnings and Precautions: severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions in any or multiple organs, which can occur during or after treatment, including pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, dermatologic reactions, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection; severe and life-threatening infusion or injection-related reactions; fatal and other serious complications in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation before or after beginning treatment; embryo-fetal toxicity; and increased mortality in patients with multiple myeloma when KEYTRUDA or KEYTRUDA QLEX is added to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, which is not recommended outside of controlled trials. Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all such possible severe or fatal reactions. For more information, see \u201cSelected Important Safety Information\u201d below.\n\u201cHistorically, the prognosis has been poor for patients living with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer who have limited treatment options that may reduce the risk of disease progression or death. These approvals mark an important moment for the ovarian cancer community, reflecting years of focused investment in KEYTRUDA,\u201d said Dr. Gursel Aktan, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cIntroducing the first PD-1 inhibitors for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer means we\u2019re expanding what\u2019s possible for patients facing this disease. It also reinforces our commitment to advancing innovative therapies and improved outcomes across women\u2019s cancers, where the need is greatest.\u201d\nIn patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS \u22651), the median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 7.0-9.4) for those receiving KEYTRUDA plus paclitaxel, with or without bevacizumab, versus 7.2 months (95% CI, 6.2-8.1) for those receiving placebo plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab. The median OS for these patients receiving the KEYTRUDA regimen was 18.2 months (95% CI, 15.3-21.0) versus 14.0 months (95% CI, 12.5-16.1) for those receiving the placebo regimen.\nOf the 643 enrolled patients, 72% of patients had tumors expressing PD-L1 (CPS \u22651), 73% received bevacizumab in the study, and 46% received prior bevacizumab. A total of 47% had a platinum-free interval of less than 3 months. Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status.\nThe safety of KEYTRUDA in combination with paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab was evaluated in 463 patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS \u22651) enrolled in KEYNOTE-B96. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 7.4 months (range 1 day to 35.9 months).\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 54% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA and paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab.

The primary endpoint is PFS, as assessed by investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and OS is a key secondary endpoint. The trial enrolled 643 patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma who received one or two prior lines of systemic therapy for ovarian carcinoma, including at least one line of platinum-based chemotherapy.\nAll study medications were administered as an intravenous infusion. KEYTRUDA 400 mg or placebo were administered on Day 1 of each 6-week treatment cycle and paclitaxel 80 mg/m\n2\nwas administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 3-week treatment cycle. The option to use bevacizumab was by investigator choice prior to randomization. Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg was administered on Day 1 of a 2-week treatment cycle. Treatment with KEYTRUDA continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of KEYTRUDA was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks for the first year, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter.\nAbout platinum-resistant ovarian cancer\nOvarian cancer often begins in the fallopian tubes or the ovaries. As of 2022, it is the eighth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the eighth leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. In the U.S., it is estimated there will be approximately 21,010 patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer and about 12,450 deaths from the disease in 2026. Over 80% of patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer will experience disease progression following standard treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. Approximately 25% of these patients develop resistance within six months of completing first-line platinum-based chemotherapy \u2013 defined as primary platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Prognosis is particularly poor for these patients and approved treatment options are limited.\nAbout KEYTRUDA\n\u00ae\n(pembrolizumab) injection for intravenous use, 100 mg\nKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body\u2019s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.\nMerck has the industry\u2019s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.\nAbout KEYTRUDA QLEX\u2122 (pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph) injection for subcutaneous use\nKEYTRUDA QLEX is a fixed-combination drug product of pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa. Pembrolizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody and berahyaluronidase alfa enhances dispersion and permeability to enable subcutaneous administration of pembrolizumab. KEYTRUDA QLEX is administered as a subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, avoiding the 5 cm area around the navel, over one minute every three weeks (2.4 mL) or over two minutes every six weeks (4.8 mL).\nSelected KEYTRUDA\n\u00ae\n(pembrolizumab) and KEYTRUDA QLEX\u2122 (pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph) Indications in the U.S.\nOvarian Cancer\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are each indicated, in combination with paclitaxel, with or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of adult patients with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS \u22651) as determined by an FDA-authorized test, and who have received 1 or 2 prior systemic treatment regimens.\nSee additional selected KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.\nSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX\nContraindications\nKEYTRUDA QLEX is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to berahyaluronidase alfa, hyaluronidase or to any of its excipients.\nSevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are monoclonal antibodies that belong to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.\nMonitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA or KEYTRUDA QLEX in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX require interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis.

Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.4% (1/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions.\nKEYTRUDA With Axitinib or KEYTRUDA QLEX With Axitinib\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX, when either is used in combination with axitinib, can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib or KEYTRUDA QLEX and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.\nWith the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT \u22653 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\nAdrenal Insufficiency\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

The increase was due to an amendment to the collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca in 2025, which discontinued the provisions whereby the Company shared revenue and costs with AstraZeneca, and revised the payment structure, resulting in the Company\u2019s recognition of a $150 million upfront payment and $175 million of regulatory milestones.\nFull-year 2025 Pharmaceutical sales were $58.1 billion, representing growth of 1% both nominally and excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Sales growth was primarily driven by higher sales in oncology, particularly KEYTRUDA and WELIREG, as well as increased alliance revenue from Koselugo (resulting from the amendment to the collaboration agreement noted above), Reblozyl and Lynparza. Also contributing to sales growth were higher sales in the cardiometabolic and respiratory franchise largely attributable to the ongoing launch of WINREVAIR, as well as the inclusion of OHTUVAYRE sales resulting from the acquisition of Verona Pharma, which closed on Oct. 7, 2025. Growth in the diabetes franchise, largely attributable to higher net pricing of JANUVIA in the U.S., also contributed to sales growth. Sales growth in 2025 was partially offset by lower sales in the vaccines franchise reflecting lower sales of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9, which were offset in part by the ongoing launch of CAPVAXIVE and the U.S. launch of ENFLONSIA. Lower sales in the immunology franchise (due to the return of the marketing rights for Simponi and Remicade in former Company territories to Johnson & Johnson on Oct. 1, 2024) and lower sales in the virology franchise (largely attributable to LAGEVRIO) also offset Pharmaceutical sales growth in 2025.\nFull-year 2025 Animal Health sales were $6.4 billion, representing growth of 8%, or 9% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Sales growth was primarily driven by the performance of Livestock products across all species and new product launches in Companion Animal. Sales of the BRAVECTO line of products were $1.1 billion in 2025, representing growth of 1% both nominally and excluding the impact of foreign exchange.\nFourth-Quarter and Full-Year Expense and Related Information\nThe table below presents selected expense information.\n$ in millions\nGAAP\nAcquisition-\nand\nDivestiture-\nRelated Costs\n3\nRestructuring\nCosts\n(Income)\nLoss From\nInvestments\nin Equity\nSecurities\nNon-\nGAAP\n2\nFourth Quarter 2025\nCost of sales\n$5,551\n$1,054\n$1,173\n$-\n$3,324\nSelling, general and administrative\n2,898\n48\n2\n-\n2,848\nResearch and development\n3,886\n5\n(111)\n-\n3,992\nRestructuring costs\n213\n-\n213\n-\n-\nOther (income) expense, net\n432\n-\n-\n206\n226\nFourth Quarter 2024\nCost of sales\n$3,828\n$701\n$121\n$-\n$3,006\nSelling, general and administrative\n2,864\n29\n16\n-\n2,819\nResearch and development\n4,585\n12\n(1)\n-\n4,574\nRestructuring costs\n51\n-\n51\n-\n-\nOther (income) expense, net\n126\n(31)\n-\n152\n5\n$ in millions\nGAAP\nAcquisition-\nand\nDivestiture-\nRelated Costs\n3\nRestructuring\nCosts\n(Income)\nLoss From\nInvestments\nin Equity\nSecurities\nNon-\nGAAP\n2\nYear Ended Dec. 31, 2025\nCost of sales\n$16,382\n$2,871\n$1,484\n$-\n$12,027\nSelling, general and administrative\n10,733\n120\n3\n-\n10,610\nResearch and development\n15,789\n19\n175\n-\n15,595\nRestructuring costs\n889\n-\n889\n-\n-\nOther (income) expense, net\n151\n(3)\n-\n(306)\n460\nYear Ended Dec. 31, 2024\nCost of sales\n$15,193\n$2,409\n$495\n$-\n$12,289\nSelling, general and administrative\n10,816\n117\n83\n-\n10,616\nResearch and development\n17,938\n72\n1\n-\n17,865\nRestructuring costs\n309\n-\n309\n-\n-\nOther (income) expense, net\n(24)\n(79)\n-\n45\n10\nGAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information\nGross margin was 66.2% for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with 75.5% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Gross margin was 74.8% for the full year of 2025 compared with 76.3% for the full year of 2024. The gross margin decline in both periods was primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of higher restructuring costs (primarily related to the accelerated depreciation of manufacturing lines at two sites under the 2025 Restructuring Program), inventory write-offs and amortization of intangible assets, as well as the recognition of inventory fair value step-up related to the Verona Pharma acquisition, partially offset by the favorable impact of product mix.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025, an increase of 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, partially offset by lower promotional costs. Full-year 2025 SG&A expenses were $10.7 billion, a decrease of 1% compared with the full year of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower restructuring and promotional costs, partially offset by increased administrative costs.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025, a decrease of 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower charges for business development activity and a reduction to estimated contractual termination costs associated with restructuring actions, partially offset by higher clinical development costs. R&D expenses were $15.8 billion for the full year of 2025, a decrease of 12% compared with the full year of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower charges for business development activity, partially offset by higher clinical development spending and higher restructuring costs.\nOther (income) expense, net, was $432 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with $126 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher net interest expense, higher foreign exchange losses and increased net losses from investments in equity securities. Other (income) expense, net, was $151 million of expense in the full year of 2025 compared with $24 million of income in the full year of 2024. The unfavorable year-over-year change primarily reflects $170 million of income in 2024 related to the expansion of an existing development and commercialization agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, as well as higher net interest expense and higher foreign exchange losses in 2025, partially offset by higher net income from investments in equity securities in 2025.\nThe effective tax rate was 13.4% for the fourth quarter of 2025 and 13.3% for the full year of 2025.\nGAAP EPS was $1.19 for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with $1.48 for the fourth quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by higher restructuring costs and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by favorability from lower charges for business development transactions, as well as operational strength in the business driven in part by the benefits of the previously announced multiyear optimization initiative. GAAP EPS was $7.28 for the full year of 2025 compared with $6.74 for the full year of 2024. The increase was primarily driven by favorability from lower charges for business development transactions and operational strength in the business, partially offset by higher restructuring costs and amortization of intangible assets.\nNon-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information\nNon-GAAP gross margin was 79.7% for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with 80.8% for the fourth quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to higher inventory write-offs, partially offset by the favorable impact of product mix. Non-GAAP gross margin was 81.5% for the full year of 2025 compared with 80.8% for the full year of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of product mix, partially offset by higher inventory write-offs.\nNon-GAAP SG&A expenses were $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025, an increase of 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, partially offset by lower promotional costs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $10.6 billion for the full year of 2025, flat compared with the full year of 2024 as lower promotional costs were largely offset by higher administrative costs.\nNon-GAAP R&D expenses were $4.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025, a decrease of 13% compared with the fourth quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $15.6 billion for the full year of 2025, a decrease of 13% compared with the full year of 2024. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to lower charges for business development activity, partially offset by higher clinical development costs.\nNon-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $226 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with $5 million of expense in the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher net interest expense and higher foreign exchange losses. Non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, was $460 million of expense in the full year of 2025 compared with $10 million of expense in the full year of 2024. The unfavorable year-over-year change primarily reflects $170 million of income in 2024 related to the expansion of an existing development and commercialization agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, as well as higher net interest expense and higher foreign exchange losses in 2025.\nThe non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15.4% for the fourth quarter of 2025 and 14.4% for the full year of 2025.\nNon-GAAP EPS was $2.04 for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with $1.72 for the fourth quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP EPS was $8.98 for the full year of 2025 compared with $7.65 for the full year of 2024. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by favorability from lower charges for business development transactions, as well as operational strength in the business driven in part by the benefits of the previously announced multiyear optimization initiative.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income and EPS is provided in the table that follows.\nFourth Quarter\nYear Ended\n$ in millions, except EPS amounts\n2025\n2024\nDec. 31, 2025\nDec. 31, 2024\nEPS\nGAAP EPS\n$1.19\n$1.48\n$7.28\n$6.74\nDifference\n0.85\n0.24\n1.70\n0.91\nNon-GAAP EPS that excludes items listed below\n2\n$2.04\n$1.72\n$8.98\n$7.65\nNet Income\nGAAP net income\n1\n$2,963\n$3,743\n$18,254\n$17,117\nDifference\n2,125\n629\n4,259\n2,327\nNon-GAAP net income that excludes items listed below\n1,2\n$5,088\n$4,372\n$22,513\n$19,444\nExcluded Items:\nAcquisition- and divestiture-related costs\n3\n$1,107\n$711\n$3,007\n$2,519\nRestructuring costs\n1,277\n187\n2,551\n888\nLoss (income) from investments in equity securities\n206\n152\n(306)\n45\nDecrease to net income before taxes\n2,590\n1,050\n5,252\n3,452\nEstimated income tax (benefit) expense\n4\n(465)\n(421)\n(993)\n(1,125)\nDecrease to net income\n$2,125\n$629\n$4,259\n$2,327\nPipeline and Portfolio Highlights\nIn 2025, the Company announced positive late-stage trial results from 18 Phase 3 trials and began enrolling patients in 21 new Phase 3 studies evaluating multiple indications and therapeutic areas, with approximately 80 Phase 3 studies currently underway.\nThroughout the fourth quarter, the Company made important progress to advance its broad, diverse pipeline, meeting significant regulatory and clinical milestones.\nOncology:\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX, each in combination with Padcev, for the perioperative treatment of adult patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy based on Phase 3 KEYNOTE-905 trial.\nApprovals represent the first PD-1 inhibitor plus antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) regimens for this patient population.\nFDA awarded a priority review voucher under the Commissioner\u2019s National Priority Voucher (CNPV) pilot program for sac-TMT, an investigational anti-TROP2 ADC being developed in collaboration with Kelun-Biotech.\nEuropean Commission (EC) approved the subcutaneous route of administration and new pharmaceutical formulation of KEYTRUDA for use across all KEYTRUDA indications for adult patients in Europe.\nFDA accepted two supplemental Biologics License Applications (sBLAs) for KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX, each with Trodelvy, for the first-line treatment of certain patients with PD-L1+ inoperable (unresectable) locally advanced or metastatic TNBC based on Phase 3 KEYNOTE-D19/ASCENT-04 trial.\nFDA set Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) dates in the second half of 2026 for these applications.\nAnnounced positive topline results from Phase 3 KEYNOTE-B15 trial in patients with MIBC who are eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy showing KEYTRUDA plus Padcev significantly improved event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS) and pathologic complete response (pCR) rates versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery when given before and after surgery.\nIn collaboration with Moderna, Inc.

This agreement enables the Company to continue its long-standing commitment to advancing breakthrough scientific discoveries for patients and helps ensure Americans can access the medicines they need at lower costs. The voluntary agreement addresses all four components of the President\u2019s July letter.\nUnder the agreement, among other things, the Company plans to provide key products through a direct-to-patient program at affordable prices for eligible patients in the U.S. In addition, the Company reached an understanding with the U.S. Department of Commerce to delay Section 232 tariffs for three years, enabling the Company to make investments in the U.S. to reshore manufacturing for American patients. The Company has committed more than $70 billion in capital and R&D spending to strengthen U.S. production and innovation.\nFull-Year 2026 Financial Outlook\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s full-year financial outlook.\nFull Year 2026\nSales\n*\n$65.5 billion to $67.0 billion\nNon-GAAP Gross margin\n2\nApproximately 82%\nNon-GAAP Operating expenses\n2**\n$35.9 billion to $36.9 billion\nNon-GAAP Other (income) expense, net\n2\nApproximately $1.3 billion expense\nNon-GAAP Effective tax rate\n2\n23.5% to 24.5%\nNon-GAAP EPS\n2***\n$5.00 to $5.15\nShare count (assuming dilution)\nApproximately 2.48 billion\n*The Company does not have any non-GAAP adjustments to sales.\n**Includes a one-time charge of approximately $9.0 billion associated with the acquisition of Cidara. Outlook does not assume any additional significant potential business development transactions.\n***Includes a one-time charge of approximately $3.65 per share associated with the acquisition of Cidara.\nThe Company has not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP other (income) expense, net, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, given it cannot predict with reasonable certainty the amounts necessary for such a reconciliation, including intangible asset impairment charges, legal settlements, and income and losses from investments in equity securities either owned directly or through ownership interests in investment funds, without unreasonable effort. These items are inherently difficult to forecast and could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s future GAAP results.\nThe Company anticipates full-year 2026 sales to be between $65.5 billion and $67.0 billion, including a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1% at mid-January 2026 exchange rates.\nThe Company\u2019s full-year non-GAAP effective income tax rate is expected to be between 23.5% and 24.5% including the impact of the non-tax deductible one-time charge for the acquisition of Cidara.\nThe Company expects full-year 2026 non-GAAP EPS to be between $5.00 and $5.15, including a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately $0.10 per share at mid-January 2026 exchange rates. This range includes a one-time charge of approximately $9.0 billion, or approximately $3.65 per share, as well as approximately $0.30 per share of related financing and operational costs, related to the acquisition of Cidara. In 2025, non-GAAP EPS of $8.98 was negatively impacted by one-time charges of $0.20 per share related to certain business development transactions.\nConsistent with past practice, the financial outlook does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions.\nNon-GAAP EPS excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, costs related to restructuring programs, as well as income and losses from investments in equity securities.\nEarnings Conference Call\nInvestors, journalists and the general public may access a live audio webcast of the call on Tuesday, Feb. 3, at 9 a.m. ET via this\nweblink\n.

Management believes that providing this information enhances investors\u2019 understanding of the Company\u2019s results because management uses non-GAAP results to assess performance. Management uses non-GAAP measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the Company along with other metrics. In addition, annual employee compensation, including senior management\u2019s compensation, is derived in part using a non-GAAP pretax income metric. This information should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a description of the non-GAAP adjustments, see Table 2a attached to this release.\n3\nReflects expenses related to business combinations, including the amortization of intangible assets, intangible asset impairment charges, and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. Also includes integration, transaction and certain other costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures, as well as amortization of intangible assets related to collaborations, licensing arrangements and asset acquisitions, and recognition of fair value step-up to inventories for asset acquisitions.\n4\nIncludes the estimated tax impacts on the reconciling items based on applying the statutory rate of the originating territory of the non-GAAP adjustments for all periods presented. Amount in the full year of 2025 also includes a $60 million net benefit, which reflects a net benefit related to favorable audit reserve adjustments. Amounts in the fourth quarter and full year of 2024 also include a $260 million benefit and a $519 million benefit, respectively, due to reductions in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessments related to certain federal tax return years.

As such,\u00a0demonstrating\u00a0the longer-term potential of\u00a0intismeran\u00a0autogene\u00a0and KEYTRUDA to reduce the risk of recurrence for certain patients with melanoma is a meaningful milestone,\u201d said Dr. Marjorie Green, senior vice president and head of oncology, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cThese five-year follow up data are encouraging and we look forward to late-stage data from the\u00a0INTerpath\u00a0clinical development program with Moderna, across a range of tumor types where significant unmet needs remain.\u201d\nThis analysis from the Phase 2b KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 study (\nNCT03897881\n)builds on the\nprimary analysis\nconducted at approximately two years of follow up, as well as a\nsubsequent analysis\nat three years of follow up. The safety profile of\u00a0intismeran\u00a0autogene\u00a0in combination with KEYTRUDA in the study\u00a0remains\u00a0consistent with that previously reported.\nIn collaboration with Merck, the Phase 3 clinical trial for adjuvant melanoma (INTerpath-001,\nNCT05933577\n) is fully enrolled. Two non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Phase 3 studies, evaluating adjuvant treatment in patients with completely resected NSCLC and evaluating adjuvant treatment for patients with\u00a0resectable\u00a0NSCLC after receiving neoadjuvant KEYTRUDA plus platinum-based chemotherapy, are enrolling. The randomized Phase 2 study for adjuvant renal cell carcinoma is fully enrolled. Randomized Phase 2 studies for patients with resected muscle invasive and resected non-muscle invasive bladder cancer are enrolling, a Phase 2 study of first-line treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma and a Phase 2 study of first-line treatment for patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC are also enrolling.\nAbout\u00a0intismeran\u00a0autogene\u00a0(mRNA-4157 or V940)\nIntismeran\u00a0autogene\u00a0is a novel investigational messenger RNA (mRNA)-based individualized neoantigen therapy (INT) consisting of a synthetic mRNA coding for up to 34 neoantigens that is designed and produced based on the unique mutational signature of the DNA sequence of the patient\u2019s tumor. Upon administration into the body, the algorithmically derived and RNA-encoded neoantigen sequences are endogenously translated and undergo natural cellular antigen processing and presentation, a key step in adaptive immunity. Individualized neoantigen therapies are designed to train and activate an antitumor immune response by generating specific T-cell responses based on the unique mutational signature of a patient\u2019s tumor.\nAbout KEYNOTE-942/mRNA-4157-P201 (\nNCT03897881\n)\nKEYNOTE-942\u00a0(The Lancet, Volume 403, Issue 10427, 632 \u2013 644)\u00a0is an ongoing randomized, open-label Phase 2b trial that enrolled 157 patients with high-risk stage III/IV melanoma. Following complete surgical resection, patients were assigned 2:1 (stratified by stage) to receive\u00a0intismeran\u00a0autogene\u00a0(1 mg every three weeks for nine doses) and KEYTRUDA (200 mg every three weeks up to 18 cycles [for approximately one year]) versus KEYTRUDA alone for approximately one year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint is RFS, defined as the time from first dose of KEYTRUDA until the date of first recurrence (local,\u00a0regional\u00a0or distant metastasis), a new primary melanoma, or death from any cause in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary endpoints include distant metastasis-free\u00a0survival and safety, and exploratory endpoints include distribution of TMB expression in baseline tumor samples across study arms and their association with the primary RFS endpoint.\nKey eligibility criteria for the trial included: patients with\u00a0resectable\u00a0cutaneous melanoma metastatic to a lymph node and at high risk of recurrence, patients with complete resection within 13 weeks prior to the first dose of KEYTRUDA, patients were disease free at study entry (after surgery) with no loco-regional relapse or distant metastasis and no clinical evidence of brain metastases, patients had a formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor sample available suitable for sequencing, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0 or 1 and patients with normal organ and marrow function reported at screening.\nAbout melanoma\nMelanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades, with more than 330,000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2022. In the U.S., skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed, and melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths. It is estimated there will be over 100,000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and over 8,000 deaths resulting from the disease in the U.S. in 2025.\nAbout KEYTRUDA\n\u00ae\n(pembrolizumab) injection\u00a0for intravenous use, 100 mg\nKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body\u2019s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.\nMerck has the industry\u2019s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program\u00a0seeks\u00a0to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient\u2019s likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.\nSelected KEYTRUDA\n\u00ae\n(pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.\nMelanoma\nKEYTRUDA is\u00a0indicated\u00a0for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.\nKEYTRUDA is\u00a0indicated\u00a0for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with\u00a0Stage\u00a0IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection.\nSee\u00a0additional\u00a0selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.\nSelected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA\nSevere\u00a0and\u00a0Fatal\u00a0Immune-Mediated\u00a0Adverse\u00a0Reactions\nKEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.\nMonitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting,\u00a0monitor\u00a0blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically\u00a0indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions,\u00a0initiate\u00a0appropriate\u00a0workup\u00a0to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as\u00a0appropriate.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.\nImmune-Mediated\u00a0Pneumonitis\nKEYTRUDA\u00a0can\u00a0cause\u00a0immune-mediated\u00a0pneumonitis.\u00a0The\u00a0incidence\u00a0is\u00a0higher in patients who have received\u00a0prior\u00a0thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving\u00a0KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and\u00a0Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were\u00a0required\u00a0in 67%\u00a0(63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of\u00a0KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All\u00a0patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom\u00a0improvement;\u00a0of\u00a0these,\u00a023%\u00a0had\u00a0recurrence.\u00a0Pneumonitis\u00a0resolved\u00a0in\u00a059%\u00a0of\u00a0the 94 patients.\nPneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with\u00a0cHL\u00a0receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution.\nPneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of\u00a0patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.\nImmune-Mediated\u00a0Colitis\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may\u00a0present\u00a0with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious\u00a0workup\u00a0to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were\u00a0required\u00a0in 69% (33/48);\u00a0additional\u00a0immunosuppressant therapy was\u00a0required\u00a0in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.\nHepatotoxicity and\u00a0Immune-Mediated\u00a0Hepatitis\nKEYTRUDA\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0Single\u00a0Agent\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were\u00a0required\u00a0in 68% (13/19) of patients;\u00a0additional\u00a0immunosuppressant therapy was\u00a0required\u00a0in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis\u00a0resolved\u00a0in 79% of the 19 patients.\nKEYTRUDA\u00a0With\u00a0Axitinib\nKEYTRUDA in combination with\u00a0axitinib\u00a0can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider\u00a0monitoring\u00a0more\u00a0frequently\u00a0as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and\u00a0axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.\u00a0With the combination of KEYTRUDA and\u00a0axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of\u00a0the patients\u00a0with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT \u22653 times\u00a0upper\u00a0limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or\u00a0axitinib\u00a0(n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving\u00a0axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN\u00a0subsequently\u00a0recovered from the event.\nImmune-Mediated\u00a0Endocrinopathies\nAdrenal\u00a0Insufficiency\nKEYTRUDA\u00a0can\u00a0cause\u00a0primary\u00a0or\u00a0secondary\u00a0adrenal\u00a0insufficiency.\u00a0For\u00a0Grade\u00a02 or higher,\u00a0initiate\u00a0symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically\u00a0indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions.\u00a0Systemic corticosteroids were\u00a0required\u00a0in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\nHypophysitis\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated\u00a0hypophysitis.\u00a0Hypophysitis\u00a0can\u00a0present with\u00a0acute symptoms associated with mass\u00a0effect\u00a0such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects.\u00a0Hypophysitis\u00a0can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as\u00a0indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity.\u00a0Hypophysitis\u00a0occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were\u00a0required\u00a0in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids.\u00a0Hypophysitis\u00a0led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\nThyroid Disorders\nKEYTRUDA\u00a0can\u00a0cause\u00a0immune-mediated thyroid disorders.\u00a0Thyroiditis\u00a0can\u00a0present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically\u00a0indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred\u00a0in\u00a00.6%\u00a0(16/2799)\u00a0of\u00a0patients\u00a0receiving\u00a0KEYTRUDA,\u00a0including\u00a0Grade\u00a02 (0.3%). None\u00a0discontinued, but KEYTRUDA was withheld in <0.1% (1) of\u00a0patients.\nHyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\u00a0The majority of\u00a0patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 adult patients with\u00a0cHL\u00a0(17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, including Grade 3\u00a0(0.2%) hyperthyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism.\nType\u00a01\u00a0Diabetes\u00a0Mellitus\u00a0(DM),\u00a0Which\u00a0Can\u00a0Present\u00a0With\u00a0Diabetic\u00a0Ketoacidosis\nMonitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically\u00a0indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Type 1 DM occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. It led to permanent discontinuation in <0.1% (1) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.\nImmune-Mediated\u00a0Nephritis\u00a0With\u00a0Renal\u00a0Dysfunction\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were\u00a0required\u00a0in 89% (8/9) of patients. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) and withholding in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients.\nImmune-Mediated\u00a0Dermatologic\u00a0Adverse\u00a0Reactions\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, has occurred with anti\u2013\u00a0PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate\u00a0nonexfoliative\u00a0rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were\u00a0required\u00a0in 40% (15/38) of patients. These reactions led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% (2) and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence. The reactions\u00a0resolved\u00a0in 79% of the 38 patients.\nOther Immune-Mediated Adverse\u00a0Reactions\nThe following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis,\u00a0myelitis\u00a0and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis,\u00a0duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection,\u00a0other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.\nInfusion-Related\u00a0Reactions\nKEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA.\u00a0Monitor for\u00a0signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently\u00a0discontinue\u00a0KEYTRUDA.\nComplications\u00a0of\u00a0Allogeneic\u00a0Hematopoietic\u00a0Stem\u00a0Cell\u00a0Transplantation\u00a0(HSCT)\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic\u00a0veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\nIncreased\u00a0Mortality\u00a0in\u00a0Patients\u00a0With\u00a0Multiple\u00a0Myeloma\nIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.\nEmbryofetal\u00a0Toxicity\nBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.\u00a0Advise\u00a0women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and\u00a0advise them to\u00a0use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.\nAdverse Reactions\nIn KEYNOTE-006, KEYTRUDA was\u00a0discontinued\u00a0due to adverse reactions in 9% of 555 patients with advanced melanoma; adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) with KEYTRUDA were fatigue (28%), diarrhea (26%), rash (24%), and nausea (21%).\nIn KEYNOTE-054, when KEYTRUDA was administered as a single agent to patients with stage III melanoma, KEYTRUDA was permanently\u00a0discontinued\u00a0due to adverse reactions\u00a0in 14% of 509 patients; the most common (\u22651%) were pneumonitis (1.4%), colitis (1.2%), and diarrhea (1%).

Adverse reactions occurring in patients treated with KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy were\u00a0generally similar\u00a0to those\u00a0observed\u00a0with KEYTRUDA alone or chemotherapy alone,\u00a0with the exception of\u00a0rash (33%\u00a0all\u00a0Grades; 2.9% Grades 3-4).\nAdverse reactions occurring in patients with MSI-H or\u00a0dMMR\u00a0endometrial carcinoma who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent were\u00a0similar to\u00a0those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent.\nAdverse reactions occurring in patients with TMB-H cancer were\u00a0similar to\u00a0those occurring in patients with other solid tumors who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent.\nAdverse reactions occurring in patients with recurrent or metastatic\u00a0cSCC\u00a0or locally advanced\u00a0cSCC\u00a0were\u00a0similar to\u00a0those occurring in patients with melanoma or NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy.\nIn KEYNOTE-522, when KEYTRUDA was administered with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin or\u00a0epirubicin\u00a0and cyclophosphamide) followed by surgery and continued adjuvant treatment with KEYTRUDA as a single agent (n=778) to patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated, high-risk early-stage TNBC, fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.9% of patients, including 1 each of adrenal crisis, autoimmune encephalitis, hepatitis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, and sepsis\u00a0in association with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and myocardial infarction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA; those \u22652% were febrile neutropenia (15%), pyrexia (3.7%), anemia (2.6%), and neutropenia (2.2%). KEYTRUDA was\u00a0discontinued\u00a0in 20% of patients due to adverse reactions. The most common reactions (\u22651%) resulting in permanent discontinuation were increased ALT (2.7%), increased AST (1.5%), and rash (1%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) in patients receiving KEYTRUDA were fatigue (70%), nausea (67%), alopecia (61%), rash (52%), constipation (42%), diarrhea and peripheral neuropathy (41% each), stomatitis (34%), vomiting (31%), headache (30%), arthralgia (29%), pyrexia (28%), cough (26%), abdominal pain (24%), decreased appetite (23%), insomnia (21%), and myalgia (20%).\nIn KEYNOTE-355, when KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy (paclitaxel, paclitaxel protein-bound, or gemcitabine and carboplatin) were administered to patients with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (n=596), fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.5% of patients, including cardio-respiratory arrest (0.7%) and septic shock (0.3%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy; the serious reactions in \u22652% were pneumonia (2.9%), anemia (2.2%), and thrombocytopenia (2%). KEYTRUDA was\u00a0discontinued\u00a0in 11% of patients due to adverse reactions. The most common reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation (\u22651%) were increased ALT (2.2%), increased AST (1.5%), and pneumonitis (1.2%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) in patients receiving KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy were fatigue (48%), nausea (44%), alopecia (34%), diarrhea and constipation (28% each), vomiting and rash (26% each), cough (23%), decreased appetite (21%), and headache (20%).\nLactation\nBecause of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children,\u00a0advise women not to\u00a0breastfeed during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.\nPediatric\u00a0Use\nIn KEYNOTE-051, 173 pediatric patients (65 pediatric patients aged 6 months to younger than 12 years and 108 pediatric patients aged 12 years to 17 years) were administered KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The median duration of exposure was 2.1 months (range: 1 day to 25 months).\nAdverse reactions that occurred at a \u226510% higher rate in pediatric patients when compared to adults were pyrexia (33%), leukopenia (30%), vomiting (29%), neutropenia (28%), headache (25%), abdominal pain (23%), thrombocytopenia (22%), Grade 3 anemia (17%), decreased lymphocyte count (13%), and decreased white blood cell count (11%).\nGeriatric Use\nOf the 564 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with\u00a0enfortumab\u00a0vedotin, 44% (n=247) were 65-74 years and 26% (n=144) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in effectiveness were\u00a0observed\u00a0between patients 65 years of age or older and younger patients. Patients 75 years of age or older treated\u00a0with KEYTRUDA in combination with\u00a0enfortumab\u00a0vedotin experienced a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions than younger patients. The incidence of fatal adverse reactions was 4% in patients younger than 75 and 7% in patients 75 years or older.\nOf the 167 patients with MIBC treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with\u00a0enfortumab\u00a0vedotin, 37% (n=61) were 65-74 years and 46% (n=77) were 75 years or older. Patients 75 years of age or older treated with KEYTRUDA in combination with\u00a0enfortumab\u00a0vedotin experienced a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions than younger patients.

In both treatment arms, KEYTRUDA QLEX will be administered once every six weeks; in the comparator arm, pemetrexed will be given on days 1 and 22 of every three-week cycle and carboplatin or cisplatin will be given on days 1 and 22 for up to two three-week cycles.\n\u201cWhile outcomes for patients with NSCLC have significantly improved over the last decade, we know there is more work to do.\nKRAS\nis the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer, and the\nKRAS\nG12C mutation occurs in approximately 4% to 14% of all patients with lung cancer globally,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, vice president, global clinical development, Merck Research Laboratories. \u201cBy pairing our oral calderasib candidate with subcutaneously administered KEYTRUDA QLEX in this trial, we will evaluate whether this chemotherapy-free combination that requires no intravenous access may help improve outcomes for patients with\nKRAS\nG12C-mutant NSCLC.\u201d\nThe trial will enroll approximately 675 patients globally. The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (PFS) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (tumor proportion score [TPS] \u22651%). Secondary endpoints include PFS in all study participants and overall survival, overall response rate, duration of response and safety in both the PD-L1 (TPS \u22651%) expressor patient population and all comers.\nIn addition to KANDLELIT-007, calderasib is being investigated in the Phase 3 KANDLELIT-012 study (\nNCT06997497\n), which is evaluating calderasib in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 for the first-line treatment of certain patients with\nKRAS\nG12C-mutant locally advanced unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer, and the Phase 3 KANDLELIT-004 study (\nNCT06345729\n), which is investigating calderasib in combination with KEYTRUDA\n\u00ae\n(pembrolizumab) for the first-line treatment of certain patients with\nKRAS\nG12C-mutant locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS \u226550%). Calderasib is also currently being evaluated in the Phase 1 KANDLELIT-001 trial (\nNCT05067283\n) to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of calderasib as monotherapy and as part of various combination therapies in patients with\nKRAS\nG12C-mutant advanced solid tumors and in the Phase 2 KANDLELIT-014 study (\nNCT07209111\n) evaluating calderasib as monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab for certain patients with\nKRAS\nG12C-mutant advanced solid tumors. As\nannounced\n, data from KANDLELIT-001 were presented at the 2025 European Society for Medical Oncology Congress.\nCalderasib is being developed through a collaboration with Taiho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and Astex Pharmaceuticals (UK), a wholly owned subsidiary of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. This collaboration was\nannounced\nin January 2020.\nAbout calderasib\nCalderasib (MK-1084) is an investigational, potent and specific\nKRAS\nG12C covalent inhibitor. Mutations in\nKRAS\nare among the most prevalent mutations found in cancer, occurring with high frequency in non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic, urogenital and colorectal cancers. The\nKRAS\nG12C mutation is the most frequently observed\nKRAS\nmutation in patients, occurring in approximately 4% to 14% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) depending on their geographic location. Despite decades of research and recognition of the therapeutic importance of targeting\nKRAS\n, the development of small molecule inhibitors targeting\nKRAS\nmutations has been challenging.\nAbout lung cancer\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2022 alone, there were approximately 2.4 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths from lung cancer globally. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 80% of all cases. Early detection and screening remain an important unmet need, as 43% of lung cancer cases are not found until they are advanced.\nAbout KEYTRUDA\n\u00ae\n(pembrolizumab) injection for intravenous use, 100 mg\nKEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body\u2019s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD- L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.\nMerck has the industry\u2019s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1,600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA, including exploring several different biomarkers.\nAbout KEYTRUDA QLEX\u2122 (pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph) injection for subcutaneous use, 165 mg + 2,000 units/mL\nKEYTRUDA QLEX is a fixed-combination drug product of pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa. Pembrolizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody and berahyaluronidase alfa enhances dispersion and permeability to enable subcutaneous administration of pembrolizumab. KEYTRUDA QLEX is administered as a subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, avoiding the 5 cm area around the navel, over one minute every three weeks (2.4 mL) or over two minutes every six weeks (4.8 mL).\nSelected KEYTRUDA\n\u00ae\n(pembrolizumab) and KEYTRUDA QLEX\u2122 (pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph) Indications in the U.S.\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are each indicated, in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic nonsquamous non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX are each indicated, in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC.\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX, as single agents, are each indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with NSCLC expressing PD-L1 [tumor proportion score (TPS) \u22651%] as determined by an FDA-approved test, with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, and is:\nstage III where patients are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or\nmetastatic.\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX, as single agents, are each indicated for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS \u22651%) as determined by an FDA-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.

Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.\nMonitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA or KEYTRUDA QLEX in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate.\nWithhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX require interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation.

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 5% (13/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including fatal (0.4%), Grade 3 (2%), and Grade 2 (1.2%) adverse reactions.\nPneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution.\nImmune-Mediated Colitis\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea.

Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.4% (1/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions.\nKEYTRUDA With Axitinib or KEYTRUDA QLEX With Axitinib\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX, when either is used in combination with axitinib, can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib or KEYTRUDA QLEX and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed.\nWith the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT \u22653 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies\nAdrenal Insufficiency\nKEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Infusion-related reactions have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for Grade 1 or Grade 2 reactions. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA. Hypersensitivity and administration related systemic reactions occurred in 3.2% (8/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy, including Grade 2 (2.8%). Interrupt injection (if not already fully administered) and resume if symptoms resolve for mild or moderate systemic reactions. For severe or life-threatening systemic reactions, stop injection and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA QLEX.\nComplications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)\nFatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute and chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.\nIncreased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma\nIn trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.\nEmbryofetal Toxicity\nBased on their mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA and KEYTRUDA QLEX can each cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA or KEYTRUDA QLEX and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.\nAdverse Reactions\nIn study MK-3475A-D77, when KEYTRUDA QLEX was administered with chemotherapy in metastatic non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), serious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted full approval to BRAFTOVI\n\u00ae\n(encorafenib) in combination with cetuximab (marketed as ERBITUX\n\u00ae\n) and fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a\nBRAF V600E\nmutation based on results from the global Phase 3 BREAKWATER trial (\nNCT04607421\n).\nBRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in December 2024 based on objective response rate (ORR) results, one of the BREAKWATER trial\u2019s dual primary endpoints. The conversion from accelerated approval to full approval is based on significant benefit in outcomes for both progression-free survival (PFS), the trial\u2019s other primary endpoint, and overall survival (OS), a key secondary endpoint, from the Phase 3 portion of the study that evaluated BRAFTOVI\nin combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6, as well as the ORR results from the Cohort 3 portion of the study, which evaluated BRAFTOVI\nin combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI.\n\u201cThis landmark approval, achieved through the robust clinical benefit demonstrated in the BREAKWATER trial, validates that this targeted therapy can impact outcomes for people living with an aggressive, hard-to-treat cancer,\u201d said Aamir Malik, Executive Vice President, Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Pfizer. \u201cAs the only targeted combination regimen shown to deliver a significant improvement in certain outcomes for patients with\nBRAF V600E\n\u2011mutant metastatic colorectal cancer, BRAFTOVI is uniquely positioned to redefine first\u2011line treatment and establish a new standard of care. This approval reinforces our leadership in bringing differentiated, potentially practice\u2011changing cancer therapies to patients and healthcare providers who urgently need improved options.\u201d\n\u201cThis approval gives oncologists confidence to use encorafenib plus cetuximab in combination with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy as a first-line standard of care for patients with\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer,\u201d said Scott Kopetz, M.D., Ph.D., FACP, Professor and Deputy Chair of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and co-principal investigator of the BREAKWATER trial. \u201cThe BREAKWATER study demonstrated that these targeted combination regimens provided statistically significant benefit, providing the robust evidence we need to make treatment decisions that can meaningfully impact patient outcomes.\u201d\nIn the BREAKWATER study, the safety profile of both combination regimens continued to be consistent with the known safety profile of each respective agent in the regimen. No new safety signals were identified. The most common side effects (\u226525%) in the mFOLFOX6 regimen were peripheral neuropathy, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, vomiting, hemorrhage, abdominal pain, arthralgia, pyrexia, and constipation. The most common side effects (\u226525%) in the FOLFIRI regimen were nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, alopecia, constipation, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and rash.\nAmong patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6, 14% experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI. There was no substantial difference in chemotherapy discontinuation due to side effects in the BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 arm compared with the chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab arm. Among patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI, 9% experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI.\nThe BRAFTOVI combination regimen with mFOLFOX6 is also under regulatory review in Europe, where Pierre Fabre Laboratories has exclusive commercialization rights, and was recently approved for use in several other countries.\nAbout BREAKWATER\nBREAKWATER is a Phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial of BRAFTOVI with cetuximab, alone or in combination with mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI (both fluorouracil-based chemotherapies) in participants with previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant mCRC.\nPhase 3 Analysis: BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6:\nPatients were randomized to receive BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab (discontinued after randomization of 158 patients), BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 (n=236) or mFOLFOX6, FOLFOXIRI, or CAPOX, with or without bevacizumab (control arm) (n=243). The dual primary endpoints for these study groups are ORR and PFS as assessed by BICR. OS is a key secondary endpoint.\nAt the time of the PFS primary analysis, BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 47% compared to chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41, 0.68; p<0.0001) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Median PFS was 12.8 months (95% CI, 11.2, 15.9) with the BRAFTOVI combination regimen compared to 7.1 months (95% CI, 6.8, 8.5) with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. In a second interim analysis of median OS, BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 significantly reduced the risk of death by 51% compared to chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab (HR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38, 0.63; p<0.0001). Median OS doubled from 15.1 months with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab (95% CI, 13.7, 17.7) to 30.3 months (95% CI, 21.7, Not Estimated) with the BRAFTOVI combination regimen. These data were\npresented\nat the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and simultaneously published in the\nNew England Journal of Medicine\n.\nCohort 3 Analysis: BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI:\nIn Cohort 3, patients were randomized to receive BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI (n=73) or FOLFIRI, with or without bevacizumab (control arm) (n=74). The primary endpoint of Cohort 3 is ORR as assessed by BICR. PFS is a key secondary endpoint; OS is a secondary endpoint summarized descriptively.\nBRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and FOLFIRI demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in confirmed ORR assessed by BICR compared to patients receiving FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab (64% vs 39%, odds ratio =2.76, p=0.0011). These data were presented at the\n2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal (ASCO GI\u00ae) Cancers Symposium\n. Detailed PFS results from Cohort 3 will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting.\nAbout Colorectal Cancer (CRC)\nCRC is the third most common type of cancer in the world, with approximately 1.8 million new diagnoses in 2022.\n1\nIt is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths.\n2\nOverall, the lifetime risk of developing CRC is about 1 in 24 for men and 1 in 26 for women.\n2\nIn the U.S. alone, an estimated 158,850 people will be diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2026, and approximately 55,000 are estimated to die from the disease each year.\n3\nFor 20% of those diagnosed with CRC, the disease has metastasized, or spread, making it harder to treat, and up to 50% of patients with localized disease eventually develop metastases.\n4\nBRAF\nmutations are estimated to occur in 8-12% of people with mCRC and are associated with a poor prognosis for these patients.\n5\nThe\nBRAF V600E\nmutation is the most common\nBRAF\nmutation, and the risk of mortality in CRC patients with the\nBRAF V600E\nmutation is more than double that of patients with no known mutation present.\n5-7\nDespite the high unmet need in\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant mCRC, prior to the BRAFTOVI accelerated FDA approval in this indication on December 20, 2024, there were no approved biomarker-driven therapies specifically indicated for people with previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant mCRC.\n8,9\nAbout BRAFTOVI\n\u00ae\n(encorafenib)\nBRAFTOVI is an oral small molecule kinase inhibitor that targets\nBRAF V600E\n. Inappropriate activation of proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) has been shown to occur in certain cancers, including CRC.\nPfizer has exclusive rights to BRAFTOVI in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Middle East, and Africa. Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in Japan and South Korea, Medison has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in Israel and Pierre Fabre Laboratories has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in all other countries, including Europe and Asia (excluding Japan and South Korea).\nINDICATION AND USAGE\nBRAFTOVI\n\u00ae\n(encorafenib) is indicated, in combination with cetuximab and fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a\nBRAF\nV600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-authorized test.\nLimitations of Use\n: BRAFTOVI is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild-type\nBRAF\nCRC.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nRefer to the prescribing information for cetuximab and individual product components of mFOLFOX6 and FOLFIRI for recommended dosing and additional safety information.\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nNew Primary Malignancies:\nNew primary malignancies, cutaneous and noncutaneous, can occur. In the BREAKWATER trial, the following cutaneous malignancies occurred in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6: melanocytic nevus in 5.6%, skin papilloma in 3%, basal cell carcinoma in 1.3%, squamous cell carcinoma of skin in 0.9%, keratoacanthoma in 0.4% and malignant melanoma in situ in 0.4%. In patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI, skin papilloma occurred in 2.8% and keratoacanthoma in 1.4% of patients. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiating treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of treatment. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Dose modification is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies. Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. Monitor patients receiving BRAFTOVI for signs and symptoms of noncutaneous malignancies. Discontinue BRAFTOVI for RAS mutation-positive noncutaneous malignancies. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of treatment, while on treatment, and after discontinuation of treatment.\nTumor Promotion in\nBRAF\nWild-Type Tumors:\nIn vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of\nBRAF\nV600E or V600K mutation using an FDA-authorized test prior to initiating BRAFTOVI.\nCardiomyopathy:\nCardiomyopathy manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, has been reported in patients. Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan prior to initiating treatment, 1 month after initiating treatment, and then every 2 to 3 months during treatment. The safety has not been established in patients with a baseline ejection fraction that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN). Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored closely. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\nHepatotoxicity:\nHepatotoxicity can occur. In the BREAKWATER trial, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was 2.6% for alkaline phosphatase, 1.3% each for ALT and AST. In patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests was 1.5% each for ALT and AST. Monitor liver laboratory tests before initiation of BRAFTOVI, monthly during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\nHemorrhage:\nHemorrhage can occur. In the BREAKWATER trial, hemorrhage occurred in 34% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6; Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients. In patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI, hemorrhage occurred in 21% of patients. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\nUveitis:\nUveitis, including iritis and iridocyclitis, has been reported in patients treated with BRAFTOVI. In BREAKWATER, the incidence of uveitis among patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was 0.4%. Assess for visual symptoms at each visit. Perform an ophthalmological evaluation at regular intervals and for new or worsening visual disturbances, and to follow new or persistent ophthalmologic findings. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\nQT Prolongation:\nBRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation in some patients. In the BREAKWATER trial, an increase of QTcF >500 ms was measured in 4% (9/226) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. In patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI, an increase of QTcF >500 ms was measured in 1.5% (1/65) of patients. Monitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other medicinal products associated with QT prolongation. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to and during BRAFTOVI administration. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue for QTc >500 ms.\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity:\nBRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. BRAFTOVI can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective.

The BRAFTOVI regimen demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS, a key secondary endpoint, as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) compared to treatment with FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab. Overall survival (OS), a descriptive secondary endpoint, also showed clinically meaningful prolonged improvement with the BRAFTOVI regimen.\n\u201cThese results build on the positive objective response rate data we recently shared, providing further evidence of the meaningful benefit this BRAFTOVI-based targeted approach may offer patients with\nBRAF V600E\n\u2013mutant metastatic colorectal cancer,\u201d said Jeff Legos, Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer. \u201cThe combination of significant responses and now improvement in progression\u2011free survival underscores the potential of BRAFTOVI as a potentially practice-changing treatment option for patients and families facing this challenging diagnosis.\u201d\nThe primary endpoint of this cohort of BREAKWATER was objective response rate (ORR) by BICR. Positive ORR results were achieved and recently presented at the 2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal (ASCO GI\n\u00ae\n) Cancers Symposium. At the time of the PFS analysis, the safety profile of BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI was consistent with the known profile of each regimen component and no new safety signals were identified.\nBRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI is an investigational regimen and is not currently approved. Detailed results from this cohort will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical meeting and shared with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support potential approval for BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI in patients with\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant mCRC.\nBRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 received accelerated approval by the FDA in December 2024 for patients with\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant mCRC based on a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in confirmed ORR in treatment-na\u00efve patients, one of the study\u2019s primary endpoints. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification of clinical benefit.\nAbout BREAKWATER\nBREAKWATER is a Phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial of BRAFTOVI with cetuximab, alone or in combination with chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) in participants with previously untreated BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC. Patients were randomized to receive BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab (discontinued after randomization of 158 patients), BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 (n=236) or mFOLFOX6, FOLFOXIRI, or CAPOX, with or without bevacizumab (control arm) (n=243). The dual primary endpoints for these study groups are ORR and PFS as assessed by BICR. OS is a key secondary endpoint. In Cohort 3, patients were randomized to receive BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI (n=73) or FOLFIRI, with or without bevacizumab (control-arm) (n=74). The primary endpoint of Cohort 3 is ORR as assessed by BICR. PFS is a key secondary endpoint; OS is a secondary endpoint.\nAbout Colorectal Cancer (CRC)\nCRC is the third most common type of cancer in the world, with approximately 1.8 million new diagnoses in 2022.\n1\nIt is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths.\n2\nOverall, the lifetime risk of developing CRC is about 1 in 24 for men and 1 in 26 for women.\n2\nIn the U.S. alone, an estimated 154,270 people will be diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2025, and approximately 53,000 are estimated to die from the disease each year.\n3\nFor 20% of those diagnosed with CRC, the disease has metastasized, or spread, making it harder to treat, and up to 50% of patients with localized disease eventually develop metastases.\n4\nBRAF\nmutations are estimated to occur in 8-12% of people with mCRC and represent a poor prognosis for these patients.\n5\nThe\nBRAF V600E\nmutation is the most common\nBRAF\nmutation and the risk of mortality in CRC patients with the\nBRAF V600E\nmutation is more than double that of patients with no known mutation present.\n5,6\nDespite the high unmet need in\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant mCRC, prior to December 20, 2024 there were no approved biomarker-driven therapies specifically indicated for people with previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant mCRC.\n7,8\nAbout BRAFTOVI\n\u00ae\n(encorafenib)\nBRAFTOVI is an oral small molecule kinase inhibitor that targets\nBRAF\nV600E. Inappropriate activation of proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) has been shown to occur in certain cancers, including CRC.\nPfizer has exclusive rights to BRAFTOVI in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Middle East, and Africa. Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in Japan and South Korea, Medison has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in Israel and Pierre Fabre Laboratories has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in all other countries, including Europe and Asia (excluding Japan and South Korea).\nINDICATION AND USAGE\nBRAFTOVI\n\u00ae\n(encorafenib) is indicated, in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6, for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a\nBRAF V600E\nmutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).\nBRAFTOVI is also indicated, in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult patients with mCRC with a\nBRAF V600E\nmutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, after prior therapy.\nLimitations of Use\n: BRAFTOVI is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF CRC.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nRefer to the prescribing information for cetuximab and individual product components of mFOLFOX6 for recommended dosing and additional safety information.\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nNew Primary Malignancies:\nNew primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur. In BEACON CRC (previously treated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC), including keratoacanthoma (KA), occurred in 1.4% of patients with CRC, and a new primary melanoma occurred in 1.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab. In BREAKWATER (previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC) skin papilloma was reported in 2.6%, basal cell carcinoma in 1.3%, squamous cell carcinoma of skin in 0.9%, keratoacanthoma in 0.4% and malignant melanoma in situ in 0.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiating treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of treatment. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Dose modification is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies. Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. Monitor patients receiving BRAFTOVI for signs and symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. Discontinue BRAFTOVI for RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of treatment, while on treatment, and after discontinuation of treatment.\nTumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors:\nIn vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of\nBRAF V600E\nor\nV600K\nmutation using an FDA-approved test prior to initiating BRAFTOVI.\nCardiomyopathy:\nCardiomyopathy manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, has been reported in patients. Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan prior to initiating treatment, 1 month after initiating treatment, and then every 2 to 3 months during treatment. The safety has not been established in patients with a baseline ejection fraction that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN). Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored closely. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\nHepatotoxicity:\nHepatotoxicity can occur. In BREAKWATER (previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC), the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was 2.2% for alkaline phosphatase, 1.3% for ALT, and 0.9% for AST. Monitor liver laboratory tests before initiation of BRAFTOVI, monthly during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\nHemorrhage:\nIn BEACON CRC (previously treated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC), hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage occurred in 1.9% of patients, including fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 0.5% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were epistaxis (6.9%), hematochezia (2.3%), and rectal hemorrhage (2.3%). In BREAKWATER (previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC), hemorrhage occurred in 30% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6; Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\nUveitis:\nUveitis, including iritis and iridocyclitis, has been reported in patients treated with BRAFTOVI. Assess for visual symptoms at each visit. Perform an ophthalmological evaluation at regular intervals and for new or worsening visual disturbances, and to follow new or persistent ophthalmologic findings. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\nQT Prolongation:\nBRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation in some patients. In BREAKWATER (previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC), an increase of QTcF >500 ms was measured in 3.6% (8/222) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Monitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other medicinal products associated with QT prolongation. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to and during BRAFTOVI administration. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue for QTc >500 ms.\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity:\nBRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. BRAFTOVI can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective nonhormonal contraception during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the final dose.\nRisks Associated with Combination Treatment:\nBRAFTOVI is indicated for use as part of a regimen in combination with cetuximab, or in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Refer to the prescribing information for cetuximab and individual product components of mFOLFOX6 for additional risk information.\nLactation:\nAdvise women not to breastfeed during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the final dose.\nInfertility:\nAdvise males of reproductive potential that BRAFTOVI may impair fertility.\nADVERSE REACTIONS\nBREAKWATER Trial (previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC)\nSerious adverse reactions\noccurred in 38% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Serious adverse reactions in >3% of patients included intestinal obstruction (3.5%) and pyrexia (3.5%).\nFatal gastrointestinal perforation\noccurred in 0.9% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6.\nMost common adverse reactions\n(\u226525%, all grades) in the BRAFTOVI with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 arm compared to the control arm (mFOLFOX6 \u00b1 bevacizumab or FOLFOXIRI \u00b1 bevacizumab or CAPOX \u00b1 bevacizumab) were peripheral neuropathy (62% vs 53%), nausea (51% vs 48%), fatigue (49% vs 38%), rash (31% vs 4%), diarrhea (34% vs 47%), decreased appetite (33% vs 25%), vomiting (33% vs 21%), hemorrhage (30% vs 18%), abdominal pain (26% vs 27%), and pyrexia (26% vs 14%).\nMost common laboratory abnormalities\n(\u226510%, grade 3 or 4) in the BRAFTOVI with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 arm compared to the control arm (mFOLFOX6 \u00b1 bevacizumab or FOLFOXIRI \u00b1 bevacizumab or CAPOX \u00b1 bevacizumab) were: increased lipase (51% vs 25%), decreased neutrophil count (36% vs 34%), decreased hemoglobin (13% vs 5%), decreased white blood cell count (12% vs 7%), and increased glucose (11% vs 2%).\nBEACON CRC Trial (previously treated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC)\nMost common adverse reactions\n(\u226525%, all grades) in the BRAFTOVI with cetuximab arm compared to irinotecan with cetuximab or FOLFIRI with cetuximab (control) were: fatigue (51% vs 50%), nausea (34% vs 41%), diarrhea (33% vs 48%), dermatitis acneiform (32% vs 43%), abdominal pain (30% vs 32%), decreased appetite (27% vs 27%), arthralgia (27% vs 3%), and rash (26% vs 26%).\nOther clinically important adverse reactions\noccurring in <10% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab was pancreatitis.\nMost common laboratory abnormalities\n(all grades) (\u226520%) in the BRAFTOVI with cetuximab arm compared to irinotecan with cetuximab or FOLFIRI with cetuximab (control) were: anemia (34% vs 48%) and lymphopenia (24% vs 35%).\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\nStrong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors:\nAvoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit juice. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the BRAFTOVI dose.\nStrong CYP3A4 inducers:\nAvoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nSensitive CYP3A4 substrates:\nAvoid the coadministration of BRAFTOVI with CYP3A4 substrates (including hormonal contraceptives) for which a decrease in plasma concentration may lead to reduced efficacy of the substrate. If the coadministration cannot be avoided, see the CYP3A4 substrate product labeling for recommendations.\nDose reductions of drugs that are\nsubstrates of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP\nmay be required when used concomitantly with BRAFTOVI.\nAvoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with\ndrugs known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nView the full Prescribing Information\n.\nAbout Pfizer Oncology\nAt Pfizer Oncology, we are at the forefront of a new era in cancer care.

(NYSE: PFE)\ntoday announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted and granted Priority Review for the company\u2019s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for HYMPAVZI\n\u00ae\n(marstacimab) to expand the approved indication to include the treatment of hemophilia A or B patients 6 years and older with inhibitors, and pediatric patients (ages 6 to 11) with hemophilia A or B without inhibitors. In the U.S., HYMPAVZI is currently approved for the treatment of patients 12 years of age and older with hemophilia A without factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitors, or hemophilia B without factor IX (FIX) inhibitors.\nThe FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date in the second quarter of 2026. If approved, HYMPAVZI would offer a combination of bleed protection with a straightforward, once-weekly subcutaneous injection administration, requiring minimal preparation and no routine treatment-related lab monitoring for these difficult-to-treat patient populations.\n\u201cThere is a significant medical need for younger patients with hemophilia and for those who have developed inhibitors, which neutralize factor replacement therapies and render them ineffective,\u201d said Michael Vincent, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Inflammation & Immunology Officer, Pfizer. \u201cBased on the findings in the BASIS clinical trial program and if approved, we believe HYMPAVZI has the potential to become a transformative option for these patients that have limited or burdensome treatment options today. We look forward to progressing discussions with regulators to make this medicine available for patients.\u201d\nHemophilia is diagnosed in early childhood and impacts more than 800,000 people worldwide.\n1\nThe inability of the blood to clot properly can increase the risk of painful bleeding, including inside the joints, which can cause joint scarring and damage.\n2,3\nChildren\u2019s joints have growing cartilage and bone, which makes them particularly susceptible to damage caused by repeated bleeding episodes.\n4\nInhibitors, or antibodies, develop in approximately 20% of people with hemophilia A and 3% of people with hemophilia B. People living with inhibitors to FVIII and FIX are unable to continue taking factor replacement therapies as they no longer prevent or stop bleeding episodes, particularly in individuals who are refractory to immune tolerance induction therapy.\n1,5,6\n\u201cFor children living with hemophilia A or B between ages 6 and 11, treatment approaches that prevent bleeds are particularly important to protect growing joints,\u201d said Guy Young, M.D., Director, Hemostasis and Thrombosis Center at Children's Hospital, Los Angeles. \u201cHYMPAVZI would address a critical unmet medical need for these patients and those with inhibitors if approved, particularly patients ages 6 to 11 with hemophilia B who do not have non-factor treatment options available today.\u201d\nThe FDA grants Priority Review to medicines that may offer significant advances in treatment or may provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Priority Review designation by the FDA shortens the standard sBLA review period by four months.\nThe FDA also granted HYMPAVZI Breakthrough Therapy Designation for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in younger pediatric (\u22656 to <12 years of age) patients with hemophilia B with and without inhibitors. The FDA\u2019s Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of medicines with the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening disease, when preliminary clinical evidence indicates the medicine may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies.\nThe submission for HYMPAVZI in adults and adolescents is based on efficacy and safety data from the inhibitor cohort of the Phase 3 BASIS trial (\nNCT03938792\n). The submission for HYMPAVZI in children aged 6 to 11 years with or without inhibitors is supported by efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 BASIS KIDS trial (\nNCT05611801\n).\nThe use of HYMPAVZI for the treatment of patients 12 years and older living with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors is also under review by the European Medicines Agency.\nAbout HYMPAVZI\nDiscovered by Pfizer scientists, HYMPAVZI has a unique mechanism of action that is differentiated from FVIII and FIX replacement treatments. Instead of replacing missing or insufficient clotting factors, HYMPAVZI is intentionally designed to target tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), one of the body\u2019s natural mechanisms that inhibits the initiation of blood clotting. By targeting the Kunitz 2 domain of TFPI, HYMPAVZI may help re-establish balance between bleeding and blood clot formation with the goal of offering a combination of bleed protection and straightforward administration.\nHYMPAVZI is a hemophilia treatment that has received regulatory approvals in more than 40 countries for eligible patients living with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors, or hemophilia B without factor IX inhibitors. HYMPAVZI was the first anti-TFPI approved in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of hemophilia A or B and the first hemophilia medicine approved in the U.S. and EU to be administered via a pre-filled, auto-injector pen. For eligible people living with hemophilia B, it is the first once-weekly subcutaneous prophylactic treatment. HYMPAVZI is a subcutaneous treatment option with a once-weekly dosing schedule and minimal preparation required for each individual administration.\nAbout the BASIS Clinical Trial\nThe pivotal BASIS study is a global, Phase 3, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy data and safety profile of HYMPAVZI in adolescent and adult participants ages 12 to <75 years with severe hemophilia A (defined as FVIII <1%) or moderately severe to severe hemophilia B (defined as FIX activity \u22642%) with or without inhibitors. The with inhibitor cohort included 48 people living with hemophilia with inhibitors who were treated with HYMPAVZI during a 12-month active treatment period (ATP) versus an on-demand intravenous regimen with bypassing agents, administered as part of usual care in a six-month observational period. During the ATP, participants received prophylaxis (a 300 mg subcutaneous loading dose of HYMPAVZI, followed by 150 mg subcutaneously once weekly) with potential for dose escalation to 300 mg once weekly. An additional three patients in the inhibitor cohort were on routine prophylactic treatment prior to the study and not included in the primary efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint measures the treated ABR (annualized bleeding rate) during the 12-month ATP with HYMPAVZI compared to treated ABR on prior on-demand bypass therapy. For further information, visit\nclinicaltrials.gov\n.\nAbout the BASIS KIDS Clinical Trial\nThe BASIS KIDS study is a global, Phase 3, open-label study investigating the safety and efficacy of HYMPAVZI in children 1 to <18 years of age with severe hemophilia A or moderately severe to severe hemophilia B with or without inhibitors. There were 68 patients aged 6 to 11 years treated with HYMPAVZI during a 12-month ATP versus routine prophylaxis with factor replacement therapy (without inhibitor), or routine prophylaxis or on-demand treatment with bypassing agents (with inhibitor), administered as part of usual care in a 12-month period prior to enrollment. During the ATP in this age group, participants received prophylaxis (a 150 mg subcutaneous loading dose of HYMPAVZI, followed by 75 mg subcutaneous once weekly) with the potential for dose escalation to 150 mg once weekly. The primary endpoint measures treated ABR during the 12-month ATP with HYMPAVZI compared to ABR on prior routine prophylaxis with factor replacement therapy, or routine prophylaxis or on-demand treatment with bypassing agents. For further information, visit\nclinicaltrials.gov\n.\nAbout Hemophilia\nHemophilia is a family of rare genetic blood diseases caused by a clotting factor deficiency (FVIII in hemophilia A, FIX in hemophilia B), which prevents normal blood clotting. Hemophilia is diagnosed in early childhood and impacts more than 800,000 people worldwide.\n1\nThe inability of the blood to clot properly can increase the risk of painful bleeding, including inside the joints, which can cause joint scarring and damage. People living with hemophilia can suffer permanent joint damage following repeated bleeding episodes.\n2,3\nChildren\u2019s joints have growing cartilage and bone, which makes them particularly susceptible to damage caused by repeated bleeding episodes.\n4\nFor decades, the most common treatment approach for hemophilia A and B has been factor replacement therapy, which replaces the missing clotting factors.\n2,7\nFactor replacement therapies increase the amount of clotting factor in the body to levels that improve clotting, resulting in less bleeding.\n2,3\nThe burden of intravenous infusions is believed to be a barrier to treatment adherence for some people living with hemophilia due in part to inconvenience, time constraints, and poor venous access.\n8,9\nApproximately 20% of people with hemophilia A and 3% of people with hemophilia B are unable to continue taking factor replacement therapies because they develop inhibitors to FVIII and FIX, respectively.\n1,6,7\nThese patients often have higher treatment burden, including potential complications from bleeding such as hospitalization and death, as well as higher treatment-related costs.\n10,11,12\nHYMPAVZI (marstacimab-hncq) U.S. Important Safety Information\nImportant: Before you start using HYMPAVZI, it is very important to talk to your healthcare provider about using factor VIII and factor IX products\n(products that help blood clot but work in a different way than HYMPAVZI). You may need to use factor VIII or factor IX medicines to treat episodes of breakthrough bleeding during treatment with HYMPAVZI. Carefully follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions regarding when to use factor VIII or factor IX medicines and the prescribed dose during your treatment with HYMPAVZI.\nBefore using HYMPAVZI, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:\nhave a planned surgery. Your healthcare provider may stop treatment with HYMPAVZI before your surgery. Talk to your healthcare provider about when to stop using HYMPAVZI and when to start it again if you have a planned surgery.\nhave a severe short-term (acute) illness such as an infection or injury.\nhave been told that you have a risk for blood clots.\nare pregnant or plan to become pregnant. HYMPAVZI may harm your unborn baby.\nFemales who are able to become pregnant:\nYour healthcare provider will do a pregnancy test before you start your treatment with HYMPAVZI.\nYou should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with HYMPAVZI and for at least 2 months after the last dose of HYMPAVZI.\nTell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think that you may be pregnant during treatment with HYMPAVZI.\nare breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if HYMPAVZI passes into your breast milk.\nTell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take,\nincluding prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.\nWhat are the possible side effects of HYMPAVZI?\nHYMPAVZI may cause serious side effects, including:\nblood clots (thromboembolic events).\nHYMPAVZI may increase the risk for your blood to clot in blood vessels in your arm, leg, lung, or head which can be life-threatening. Blood clots have happened in people using HYMPAVZI. You may have an increased risk of blood clots if you have certain risk factors. Stop using HYMPAVZI and get medical help right away if you develop any of these signs or symptoms of blood clots:\nswelling or pain in arms or legs\nredness or discoloration in your arms or legs\nshortness of breath\npain in chest or upper back\nfast heart rate\ncough up blood\nfeel faint\nheadache\nnumbness in your face\neye pain or swelling\ntrouble seeing\nallergic reactions.\nHYMPAVZI may cause allergic reactions, including rash and itching. Stop using HYMPAVZI and get medical help right away if you develop any of the following symptoms of a severe allergic reaction:\nswelling of your face, lips, mouth, or tongue\ntrouble breathing\nwheezing\ndizziness or fainting\nfast heartbeat or pounding in your chest\nsweating\nThe most common side effects of HYMPAVZI include:\nswelling, hardening, redness, bruising, and pain at injection site\nheadache\nitching\nThese are not all the possible side effects of HYMPAVZI. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.\nThe full Prescribing Information can be found\nhere\n.\nAbout Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients\u2019 Lives\nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced the launch of its program on\nTrumpRx\n, making innovative medicines more affordable and accessible to millions of Americans. Starting today, the program provides Americans a wide range of more than 30 medicines at a significant discount off list prices. This effort is part of Pfizer\u2019s broader landmark Most Favored Nation (MFN)\nagreement\nwith the U.S. government enabling patients to pay lower prices for their prescription medicines, while strengthening America\u2019s role as a global leader in pharmaceutical innovation.\n\u201cFor far too long, Americans have shouldered a disproportionate share of the global cost of innovation to help develop breakthroughs for the entire world,\u201d said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pfizer. \u201cAs the first pharmaceutical company to support President Trump in addressing this imbalance, we\u2019re proud to continue to work with the administration in ensuring affordability for American patients, while preserving America\u2019s position at the forefront of medical innovation.\u201d\nThrough the TrumpRx platform, uninsured or insured American patients who choose to self-pay outside of insurance will be offered savings that range as high as 85%, and on average 50%, for the large majority of Pfizer\u2019s primary care treatments and select specialty brands. This allows American consumers to choose what best fits their needs without hassle. More than 100 million patients are impacted by diseases these medicines treat \u2013 such as migraines, rheumatoid arthritis, menopause, atopic dermatitis, overactive bladder \u2013 and those patients will now have access to significantly discounted medicines.\nPfizer is partnering closely with GoodRx enabling patients seeking affordable treatments to have greater flexibility and options, including the ability to use a coupon at almost any U.S. pharmacy or select at-home delivery. A full list of included Pfizer brands may be found\nhere\n.\nPfizer will also continue to expand\nPfizerForAll\n, a direct-to-consumer platform launched in 2024, to offer more ways for people \u2013 and not middlemen \u2013 to be in charge of their health care.\nAbout Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients\u2019 Lives\nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives. We strive to set the standard for quality, safety and value in the discovery, development and manufacture of health care products, including innovative medicines and vaccines.

The study had two objectives:\n(1) to demonstrate PF\u20193944 could achieve continued weight loss when switching from weekly to monthly subcutaneous injections and maintain its efficacy while reducing the dosing frequency four-fold; and\n(2) to demonstrate PF\u20193944 could switch to a four-fold equivalent monthly dose while maintaining a well-tolerated and favorable safety profile.\nThe study demonstrated statistically significant weight reduction with up to 12.3% mean placebo-adjusted weight loss at week 28 (efficacy estimand*). The study included up to two titration steps and weekly dosing with PF\u20193944 until week 12, followed by monthly dosing to week 28. The primary endpoint of weight reduction from randomization to week\u200928 was superior to placebo in all four dose regimens tested (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The detailed results from VESPER-3 will be presented on June 6, 2026, at the 86\nth\nScientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association.\n\u00ae\nVESPER-3 is an ongoing 64-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in participants with obesity or overweight without type 2 diabetes. The study is designed to evaluate weekly (QW) titration phase to monthly (QM) dosing of PF\u20193944 in four different titration and QM dose arms, compared to placebo (five arms, ~n=54 per arm). Participants were randomized across four titration protocols: Arm 1 (0.4 mg QW/ 0.8 mg QW/ 3.2 mg QM); Arm 2 (0.8 mg QW/ 3.2 mg QM); Arm 3 (0.4 mg QW/ 0.8 mg QW/ 1.2 mg QW / 4.8 mg QM); Arm 4 (0.6 mg QW/ 1.2 mg QW/ 4.8 mg QM); or Arm 5 (placebo). Interim tolerability results were previously reported after 12 weeks of weekly dosing by Metsera; these topline results reflect efficacy and tolerability data from an additional 16 weeks with monthly dosing.\nAt week 28, 10% and 12.3% placebo-adjusted weight loss* was achieved in Arms 1 and 3 respectively, which are the low and medium monthly maintenance dosing regimens planned for inclusion in Phase 3. These data show robust and continuous weight loss after switching to monthly dosing, with no plateau observed at week 28, suggesting continued weight loss is expected as the study continues through week 64.\nPF\u20193944 also maintained a well-tolerated and favorable safety profile through week 28 that is consistent with the GLP-1 RA class. Observed gastrointestinal treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were predominantly mild or moderate with no more than one instance of severe nausea or vomiting observed in any dose group, and no instances of severe diarrhea. Across Arms 1 and 3, five total participants discontinued from treatment due to adverse events (AEs) in the weekly phase and five total participants discontinued from treatment due to AEs in the monthly phase. There were zero discontinuations from treatment due to AEs in the placebo group.\n\u201cThese topline results from the Phase 2b VESPER-3 study reinforce the potential of PF\u20193944 as a monthly treatment with competitive efficacy,\u201d said Jim List, MD, PhD, Chief Internal Medicine Officer. \u201cBased on the monthly dosing efficacy and tolerability demonstrated in this trial, we remain confident in our plan to include a higher 9.6 mg monthly maintenance dose of PF\u20193944 in Phase 3. With PF\u20193944 as an anchor of Pfizer\u2019s obesity pipeline, we are positioned to address critical gaps in obesity care and meet the diverse needs of patients.\u201d\nFollowing its recent acquisition of Metsera and exclusive global collaboration and license agreement with YaoPharma, Pfizer now has a diverse pipeline of clinical stage injectable and oral obesity candidates targeting GLP-1 receptor as well as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) agonists and antagonists, and amylin analogs. Pfizer is planning an expansive obesity development program across its robust pipeline, with plans to advance 20+ trials in 2026. This includes 10 Phase 3 trials of PF\u20193944, including the recently initiated Phase 3 VESPER-4 pivotal study investigating once-weekly PF\u20193944 in people with obesity or overweight and without type 2 diabetes; the planned Phase 3 VESPER-5 study investigating once-weekly PF\u20193944 in people with obesity or overweight with type 2 diabetes; the planned Phase 3 VESPER-6 study with once-monthly PF\u20193944 in obesity or overweight; and at least seven additional planned Phase 3 studies of PF\u20193944 designed to target comorbidities and increase patient optionality and access.\nAbout PF-08653944 (PF\u20193944; previously called MET-097i)\nPF\u20193944 is an ultra-long-acting fully biased GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA). It is being developed as a single agent weekly and as a monthly therapy, and in combination with various peptides including an amylin analog PF-08653945 (PF\u20193945; MET-233i) and a GIPR agonist PF-08654696 (MET-034i).\nAbout Obesity\nObesity is a growing global epidemic. In 2015, it was estimated that approximately 1.9 billion people were living with obesity or considered overweight, and this number is expected to grow to more than 2.9 billion by 2030.\ni\nObesity is a complex metabolic disease, often defined in adults as having a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30.\nii\nIt is associated with more than 200 health conditions,\niii\ncontributing to significant chronic disease burden, shortened lifespans, and growing healthcare costs. Despite recent advances in care, for many patients, current therapies are not sufficient\u2014whether due to limited efficacy, tolerability issues that impact adherence, associated muscle mass and strength loss (sarcopenia), co-morbidities that weight loss alone doesn\u2019t address, or barriers to access and affordability. New waves of innovation that better meet the diverse needs of patients are critical to effectively address this epidemic.\nAbout Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients\u2019 Lives\nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

(NYSE: PFE) today announced positive results from Cohort 3, a separate randomized cohort of the pivotal BREAKWATER trial, evaluating BRAFTOVI\n\u00ae\n(encorafenib) in combination with cetuximab (marketed as ERBITUX\n\u00ae\n) and FOLFIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan) in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a\nBRAF V600E\nmutation. At the time of this analysis, the BRAFTOVI combination regimen with FOLFIRI and cetuximab demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) compared to patients receiving standard-of-care treatment FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab (64.4% vs 39.2%, odds ratio =2.76, p=0.001). These data will be presented today in an oral presentation (Abstract 13) at the 2026 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal (ASCO GI\n\u00ae\n) Cancers Symposium and highlighted in the ASCO GI official press program.\n\u201cThese results represent a great advance for patients with\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. We\u2019ve seen this approach significantly increase the response compared to FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab, and these responses were rapid and durable,\u201d said Scott Kopetz, M.D., Ph.D., FACP, Professor and Deputy Chair of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and co-principal investigator of the BREAKWATER trial. \u201cThe trial supports the potential for another chemotherapy backbone option that may be paired with encorafenib plus cetuximab in this patient population.\u201d\nThe estimated median duration of response as assessed by BICR was not estimable with BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and FOLFIRI (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: not estimable [NE]-NE) or with FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab (95% CI: 7.0 months-NE). Of patients on BRAFTOVI plus cetuximab and FOLFIRI, 57.4% had a response lasting 6 months or longer, compared to 34.5% with FOLFIRI with or without bevacizumab.\nOverall survival (OS) data were analyzed descriptively (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.24-1.03; median follow-up of approximately 10 months for both arms). The BREAKWATER trial is ongoing with an estimated completion in 2027.\n\u201cThese data further strengthen the potential utility of BRAFOTVI for patients with\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. The significant improvement in response rates reflects the meaningful clinical benefit of this targeted combination therapy regimen for patients,\u201d said Jeff Legos, Chief Oncology Officer, Pfizer. \u201cThese results underscore the potential of BRAFTOVI as a standard of care for patients with this aggressive cancer and reflect our commitment to advancing precision medicine options that help tailor treatment based on patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\nThe safety profile of BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI was consistent with the known safety profile of each respective agent. No new safety signals were identified. The most common side effects (\u226515%) were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, alopecia, anemia, neutrophil count decreased, decreased appetite, fatigue, neutropenia, skin hyperpigmentation, dry skin, asthenia, weight decreased, arthralgia, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome, rash, white blood cell count decreased, and constipation. Among patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI, 8.5% experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI.\nBRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI is an investigational regimen and is not currently approved for use. BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 received accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2024 for patients with BRAF V600E -mutant mCRC based on a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in confirmed ORR in treatment-na\u00efve patients, one of the study\u2019s primary endpoints. Continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification of clinical benefit.\nPfizer is continuing its commitment to help non-scientists understand the latest findings with the development of abstract plain language summaries (APLS) for company-sponsored research being presented, which are written in non-technical language. Those interested in learning more can visit\nwww.Pfizer.com/apls\nto access the summaries.\nAbout BREAKWATER\nBREAKWATER is a Phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial of BRAFTOVI with cetuximab, alone or in combination with chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI) in participants with previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant mCRC. Patients were randomized to receive BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab (discontinued after randomization of 158 patients), BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 (n=236) or mFOLFOX6, FOLFOXIRI, or CAPOX, with or without bevacizumab (control arm) (n=243). The dual primary endpoints for these study groups are ORR and PFS as assessed by BICR. OS is a key secondary endpoint. In Cohort 3, patients were randomized to receive BRAFTOVI 300 mg orally once daily in combination with cetuximab and FOLFIRI (n=73) or FOLFIRI, with or without bevacizumab (control-arm) (n=74). The primary endpoint of Cohort 3 is ORR as assessed by BICR. PFS is a key secondary endpoint; OS is a secondary endpoint.\nAbout Colorectal Cancer (CRC)\nCRC is the third most common type of cancer in the world, with approximately 1.8 million new diagnoses in 2022.\n1\nIt is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths.\n2\nOverall, the lifetime risk of developing CRC is about 1 in 24 for men and 1 in 26 for women.\n2\nIn the U.S. alone, an estimated 154,270 people will be diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2025, and approximately 53,000 are estimated to die from the disease each year.\n3\nFor 20% of those diagnosed with CRC, the disease has metastasized, or spread, making it harder to treat, and up to 50% of patients with localized disease eventually develop metastases.\n4\nBRAF\nmutations are estimated to occur in 8-12% of people with mCRC and are associated with a poor prognosis for these patients.\n5\nThe\nBRAF V600E\nmutation is the most common\nBRAF\nmutation and the risk of mortality in CRC patients with the\nBRAF V600E\nmutation is more than double that of patients with no known mutation present.\n5-7\nDespite the high unmet need in\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant mCRC, prior to December 20, 2024, there were no approved biomarker-driven therapies specifically indicated for people with previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\n-mutant mCRC.\n8,9\nAbout BRAFTOVI\n\u00ae\n(encorafenib)\nBRAFTOVI is an oral small molecule kinase inhibitor that targets\nBRAF V600E\n. Inappropriate activation of proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) has been shown to occur in certain cancers, including CRC.\nPfizer has exclusive rights to BRAFTOVI in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Middle East, and Africa. Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in Japan and South Korea, Medison has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in Israel and Pierre Fabre Laboratories has exclusive rights to commercialize the product in all other countries, including Europe and Asia (excluding Japan and South Korea).\nINDICATION AND USAGE\nBRAFTOVI\n\u00ae\n(encorafenib) is indicated, in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6, for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a\nBRAF V600E\nmutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).\nBRAFTOVI is also indicated, in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult patients with mCRC with a\nBRAF V600E\nmutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, after prior therapy.\nLimitations of Use\n: BRAFTOVI is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF CRC.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nRefer to the prescribing information for cetuximab and individual product components of mFOLFOX6 for recommended dosing and additional safety information.\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nNew Primary Malignancies:\nNew primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur. In BEACON CRC (previously treated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC), including keratoacanthoma (KA), occurred in 1.4% of patients with CRC, and a new primary melanoma occurred in 1.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab. In BREAKWATER (previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC) skin papilloma was reported in 2.6%, basal cell carcinoma in 1.3%, squamous cell carcinoma of skin in 0.9%, keratoacanthoma in 0.4% and malignant melanoma in situ in 0.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiating treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of treatment. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Dose modification is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies. Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. Monitor patients receiving BRAFTOVI for signs and symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. Discontinue BRAFTOVI for RAS mutation-positive non-cutaneous malignancies. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of treatment, while on treatment, and after discontinuation of treatment.\nTumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors:\nIn vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of\nBRAF V600E\nor\nV600K\nmutation using an FDA-approved test prior to initiating BRAFTOVI.\nCardiomyopathy:\nCardiomyopathy manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, has been reported in patients. Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiogram or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan prior to initiating treatment, 1 month after initiating treatment, and then every 2 to 3 months during treatment. Safety has not been established in patients with a baseline ejection fraction that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN). Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored closely. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\nHepatotoxicity:\nHepatotoxicity can occur. In BREAKWATER (previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC), the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was 2.2% for alkaline phosphatase, 1.3% for ALT, and 0.9% for AST. Monitor liver laboratory tests before initiation of BRAFTOVI, monthly during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\nHemorrhage:\nIn BEACON CRC (previously treated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC), hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage occurred in 1.9% of patients, including fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 0.5% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were epistaxis (6.9%), hematochezia (2.3%), and rectal hemorrhage (2.3%). In BREAKWATER (previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC), hemorrhage occurred in 30% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6; Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\nUveitis:\nUveitis, including iritis and iridocyclitis, has been reported in patients treated with BRAFTOVI. Assess for visual symptoms at each visit. Perform an ophthalmological evaluation at regular intervals and for new or worsening visual disturbances, and to follow new or persistent ophthalmologic findings. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction.\nQT Prolongation:\nBRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation in some patients. In BREAKWATER (previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC), an increase of QTcF >500 ms was measured in 3.6% (8/222) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Monitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other medicinal products associated with QT prolongation. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to and during BRAFTOVI administration. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue for QTc >500 ms.\nEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity:\nBRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. BRAFTOVI can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective nonhormonal contraception during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the final dose.\nRisks Associated with Combination Treatment:\nBRAFTOVI is indicated for use as part of a regimen in combination with cetuximab, or in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Refer to the prescribing information for cetuximab and individual product components of mFOLFOX6 for additional risk information.\nLactation:\nAdvise women not to breastfeed during treatment with BRAFTOVI and for 2 weeks after the final dose.\nInfertility:\nAdvise males of reproductive potential that BRAFTOVI may impair fertility.\nADVERSE REACTIONS\nBREAKWATER Trial (previously untreated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC)\nSerious adverse reactions\noccurred in 38% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Serious adverse reactions in >3% of patients included intestinal obstruction (3.5%) and pyrexia (3.5%).\nFatal gastrointestinal perforation\noccurred in 0.9% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6.\nMost common adverse reactions\n(\u226525%, all grades) in the BRAFTOVI with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 arm compared to the control arm (mFOLFOX6 \u00b1 bevacizumab or FOLFOXIRI \u00b1 bevacizumab or CAPOX \u00b1 bevacizumab) were peripheral neuropathy (62% vs 53%), nausea (51% vs 48%), fatigue (49% vs 38%), rash (31% vs 4%), diarrhea (34% vs 47%), decreased appetite (33% vs 25%), vomiting (33% vs 21%), hemorrhage (30% vs 18%), abdominal pain (26% vs 27%), and pyrexia (26% vs 14%).\nMost common laboratory abnormalities\n(\u226510%, grade 3 or 4) in the BRAFTOVI with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 arm compared to the control arm (mFOLFOX6 \u00b1 bevacizumab or FOLFOXIRI \u00b1 bevacizumab or CAPOX \u00b1 bevacizumab) were: increased lipase (51% vs 25%), decreased neutrophil count (36% vs 34%), decreased hemoglobin (13% vs 5%), decreased white blood cell count (12% vs 7%), and increased glucose (11% vs 2%).\nBEACON CRC Trial (previously treated\nBRAF V600E\nmutation-positive mCRC)\nMost common adverse reactions\n(\u226525%, all grades) in the BRAFTOVI with cetuximab arm compared to irinotecan with cetuximab or FOLFIRI with cetuximab (control) were: fatigue (51% vs 50%), nausea (34% vs 41%), diarrhea (33% vs 48%), dermatitis acneiform (32% vs 43%), abdominal pain (30% vs 32%), decreased appetite (27% vs 27%), arthralgia (27% vs 3%), and rash (26% vs 26%).\nOther clinically important adverse reactions\noccurring in <10% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab was pancreatitis.\nMost common laboratory abnormalities\n(all grades) (\u226520%) in the BRAFTOVI with cetuximab arm compared to irinotecan with cetuximab or FOLFIRI with cetuximab (control) were: anemia (34% vs 48%) and lymphopenia (24% vs 35%).\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\nStrong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors:\nAvoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit juice. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the BRAFTOVI dose.\nStrong CYP3A4 inducers:\nAvoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong CYP3A4 inducers.\nSensitive CYP3A4 substrates:\nAvoid the coadministration of BRAFTOVI with CYP3A4 substrates (including hormonal contraceptives) for which a decrease in plasma concentration may lead to reduced efficacy of the substrate. If the coadministration cannot be avoided, see the CYP3A4 substrate product labeling for recommendations.\nDose reductions of drugs that are substrates of\nOATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP\nmay be required when used concomitantly with BRAFTOVI.\nAvoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with\ndrugs known to prolong QT/QTc interval.\nView the full Prescribing Information\n.\nAbout Pfizer Oncology\nAt Pfizer Oncology, we are at the forefront of a new era in cancer care.

This decision applies to all doses of these medicines and reflects Novo Nordisk\u2019s commitment to enhancing affordability for patients and both public and private payers dealing with the complexities of the evolving US healthcare system.\n\u201cLowering the list price of Wegovy\n\u00ae\nand Ozempic\n\u00ae\nis the best approach to address the unprecedented opportunity to help more than 100 million people living with obesity and over 35 million people with type 2 diabetes in the United States. Private and public payers, as well as patients, want access and have been calling for lower list prices,\u201d said Jamey Millar, executive vice president, US Operations of Novo Nordisk. \u201cOur actions today answer that call and remove cost barriers so the value of Wegovy\n\u00ae\nand Ozempic\n\u00ae\ncan be realized by more patients. The lower list price is intended to connect more people with our innovative medicines, specifically those whose out-of-pocket costs are linked to list price, such as individuals with high-deductible health plans or co-insurance benefit designs.\u201d\nNot all GLP-1s are the same. Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Wegovy\n\u00ae\nand Ozempic\n\u00ae\n, offering powerful efficacy and, unlike any other molecule in the GLP-1 class, it has FDA-approved medicines with indications for adults with obesity (Wegovy\n\u00ae\n), type 2 diabetes (Ozempic\n\u00ae\n), type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (Ozempic\n\u00ae\ninjection), and comorbid cardiovascular disease (Wegovy\n\u00ae\nand Ozempic\n\u00ae\n).\nThrough this action to lower list prices, Novo Nordisk seeks to improve access to these medicines for even more patients and is the latest in a series of efforts from Novo Nordisk, making it easier and more affordable for people in the US to get authentic, FDA-approved Wegovy\n\u00ae\nand Ozempic\n\u00ae\nin the way that best fits their lives. This change does not impact other access efforts, including direct-to-patient, self-pay prices.\nAbout\u00a0Wegovy\n\u00ae\nWegovy\n\u00ae\n(semaglutide) injection\u00a01.7 mg,\u00a02.4 mg and 7.2 mg (currently approved only in the EU) and\u00a0Wegovy\n\u00ae\n(semaglutide) tablets 25 mg (currently available in the US only) are prescription medicines used with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack or stroke in adults with known heart disease and with either obesity or overweight.\u00a0Moreover, Wegovy\n\u00ae\nhelps adults with obesity, or some adults with\u00a0excess weight (overweight)\u00a0who also have weight-related medical problems, to lose weight and keep the weight off.\nNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company with a heritage of more than 100 years in diabetes care.

    "full_text": "UBT251 is a triple agonist of the receptors for GLP-1, GIP and glucagon (triple G), being jointly developed by United Biotechnology and Novo Nordisk\nIn a placebo-controlled phase 2 trial in Chinese people with overweight or obesity, UBT251 led to a statistically significant mean weight loss of up to 19.7% after 24 weeks\nUBT251 appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile consistent with incretin-based therapies.\nGuangdong, China and Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, 24 February 2026\n\u2013 The United Laboratories International Holdings Limited (TUL) and Novo Nordisk A/S (Novo Nordisk) today announced topline results from a Chinese phase 2 trial of UBT251, a triple agonist of the receptors for GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon (triple G).\nUBT251 is being jointly developed by TUL\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary The United Bio-Technology (Hengqin) Co., Ltd. (United Biotechnology) and Novo Nordisk under an agreement signed in March 2025. United Biotechnology is responsible for development in Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, while Novo Nordisk is responsible for development in the rest of the world.\nThe trial, conducted by United Biotechnology, investigated the safety and efficacy of once-weekly injectable 2 mg, 4 mg and 6 mg doses of UBT251 compared to placebo in Chinese people with overweight or obesity. From a baseline mean body weight of 92.2 kg, the highest mean weight loss observed for people treated with UBT251 was 19.7% (-17.5 kg) compared to 2.0% (-1.6kg) in the placebo group after 24 weeks of treatment\n1\n.\nMoreover, all dose groups of UBT251 showed statistically significant improvements relative to placebo on key secondary endpoints, including waist circumference, blood glucose, blood pressure and lipids.\nIn the trial, UBT251 appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with incretin-based therapies.\n\u201cThe success of the phase 2 clinical trial of UBT251 in China represents another significant milestone in TUL\u2019s innovation-driven development,\u201d said Mr Tsoi Hoi Shan, Chairman of TUL. \u201cWe will continue to focus on chronic diseases, including endocrine and metabolic disorders, accelerate the further development of UBT251, and strive to bring more high-quality treatment options to patients worldwide at the earliest opportunity.\u201d\n\u201cWe are very encouraged by these data from the trial in China, which demonstrate the potential of UBT251 and its differentiated clinical profile and safety and tolerability profile,\u201d said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president, chief scientific officer and head of Research and Development at Novo Nordisk. \u201cWe look forward to reporting data from a global trial with UBT251 conducted by Novo Nordisk next year.\u201d\nNovo Nordisk recently initiated a global phase 1b/2a trial investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of different doses of UBT251 for up to 28 weeks in around 330 people living with overweight or obesity. Topline data from that trial is expected in 2027. Novo Nordisk also expects to initiate a phase 2 trial with UBT251 in people with type 2 diabetes in the second half of 2026.\nUnited Biotechnology will present detailed data from the Chinese phase 2 trial at a medical congress later this year. Based on the results of this trial, the company is planning to initiate a phase 3 trial in Chinese patients with overweight or obesity.\nAbout the Chinese phase 2 trial\nThis randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled a total of 205 Chinese patients with obesity (BMI \u2265 28.0 kg/m\u00b2) or overweight (24.0 kg/m\u00b2 \u2264 BMI < 28.0 kg/m\u00b2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity. The baseline mean body weight of the patients was 92.2 kg, with a baseline mean BMI of 33.1 kg/m\u00b2.\nPatients were randomly assigned to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of UBT251 in doses of 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, or placebo for 24 weeks.\nThe primary endpoint of the trial was the percentage change in body weight from baseline after 24 weeks of treatment.\nAbout UBT251\nUBT251 is a long-acting synthetic peptide triple agonist targeting the receptors for GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) and glucagon.\nIn March 2025, United Biotechnology entered an exclusive license agreement with Novo Nordisk A/S for UBT251. Under the agreement, Novo Nordisk obtained exclusive worldwide rights (excluding Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) to develop, manufacture and commercialise UBT251. United Biotechnology retained the rights for UBT251 in Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.\nAbout TUL and United Biotechnology\nFounded in 1990, TUL (HKEX: 3933) is mainly engaged in the research and development, production and sales of pharmaceuticals, and ranks among the leading integrated pharmaceutical companies in China. TUL currently boasts seven production bases, covering intermediate products, bulk medicine, finished products, veterinary drugs, empty capsule casings, and medical devices, with the sales networks dotted across nearly 80 countries and regions.

The trial included 809 randomised people with obesity and one or more comorbidities and with a mean baseline body weight of 114.2 kg. The trial had an open-label design, meaning that all investigators and participants were aware of the specific drug administered throughout the trial.\nWhen evaluating the effects of treatment, if all people adhered to treatment\n1\n, people treated\u00a0with CagriSema 2.4 mg/2.4 mg achieved a weight loss of 23.0% after 84 weeks compared to 25.5% with tirzepatide 15 mg. When applying the treatment-regimen estimand\n2\n, people treated with CagriSema 2.4 mg/2.4 mg achieved a weight loss of 20.2% compared to 23.6% with tirzepatide at 84 weeks. The trial did not achieve its primary endpoint of demonstrating non-inferiority on weight loss for CagriSema compared to tirzepatide after 84 weeks.\nIn the trial, CagriSema appeared to have a safe and well-tolerated profile. The most common\u00a0adverse events with CagriSema were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to\nmoderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class.\n\u201cWe are pleased with the weight loss of 23% for CagriSema in this open-label trial. CagriSema has the potential to be the first GLP-1/amylin-combination product to reach the market for people living with obesity, documenting that cagrilintide adds to the existing benefits of semaglutide and offers clinically meaningful additive weight loss effects superior to what has been observed with GLP-1 biology alone. Based on the learnings from completed studies we look forward to the REDEFINE 11 readout, and the initiation of the higher-dose CagriSema trial, which are both designed to assess the full weight-loss potential of CagriSema\u201d, said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president, R&D and chief scientific officer at Novo Nordisk. \u201cThe results in the REDEFINE programme reinforce our commitment to transforming obesity care, through novel products such as CagriSema and zenagamtide with the potential to offer even greater health benefits for patients living with obesity.\u201d\nCagriSema for weight management was submitted to the US FDA in December 2025 based on the REDEFINE 1 and REDEFINE 2 pivotal trials, and an FDA decision is anticipated by late 2026. The REDEFINE 11 phase 3 trial exploring CagriSema 2.4/2.4 mg full weight-loss potential in obesity is expected to report data during the first half of 2027, while initiation of the phase 3 CagriSema higher-dose trial is planned for the second half of 2026.\nConference call\nNovo Nordisk will host a conference call for investors at 11.30 CEST on 23 February 2026, corresponding to 5:30 am EDT. A dial-in link to the conference call will be published on the investor section of novonordisk.com.\nAbout CagriSema\nOnce-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema is being investigated by Novo Nordisk as a treatment for adults with overweight or obesity (REDEFINE programme) and as a treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes (REIMAGINE programme). CagriSema is a fixed-dose combination of a long-acting amylin analogue, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg. The two molecules induce weight loss by reducing hunger, increasing feelings of fullness and thereby help people eat less and reduce their calorie intake.\nAbout the REDEFINE programme\nREDEFINE is a phase 3 clinical development programme with once-weekly subcutaneous CagriSema in obesity. The global clinical trial programme includes two pivotal phase 3 trials, which included approximately 4,600 adults with overweight or obesity. The phase 3 trial programme includes:\nREDEFINE 1 \u2013 a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema 2.4 mg/2.4 mg, cagrilintide 2.4 mg and semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo in 3,417 adults with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities and without type 2 diabetes.\nREDEFINE 2 \u2013 a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema 2.4 mg/2.4 mg versus placebo in 1,206 adults with type 2 diabetes and either obesity or overweight.\nREDEFINE 3 \u2013 an event-driven cardiovascular outcomes phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema 2.4 mg/2.4 mg versus placebo in 7,000 adults with established cardiovascular disease with or without type 2 diabetes.\nREDEFINE 8 \u2013 a 104-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema 2.4 mg/2.4 mg versus placebo in 400 adults with obesity, including assessments on body composition. The trial includes a 52-week extension phase investigating maintenance of weight loss with CagriSema 2.4 mg/2.4 mg or a dose-tapering algorithm.\nREDEFINE 9 \u2013 a 68-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly CagriSema 1.7 mg/1.7 mg and CagriSema 1.0 mg/1.0 mg versus placebo in 300 adults with overweight or obesity.\nREDEFINE 11 \u2013 an 80-week efficacy and safety phase 3 trial of once-weekly\u00a0CagriSema\u00a02.4 mg/2.4 mg versus placebo in 600 adults with obesity. The trial includes an 80-week extension phase investigating the maintenance of weight loss.\nHigh-dose CagriSema\u00a02.4 mg/7.2 mg,\u00a0an efficacy and safety phase 3 trial, is planned to be initiated\u00a0in the second half of 2026 in adults with obesity.\nNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

    "full_text": "The European Commission has granted final approval of a higher 7.2 mg maintenance dose of Wegovy\n\u00ae\n(semaglutide) for adults who may need extra help losing weight. It is now approved in all 27 countries in the European Union\nIn a study with 1,407 people, lasting about 1\u00bd years, those on the higher dose lost, on average, about one\u2011fifth of their body weight.\nWegovy is now approved in the EU as a once\u2011weekly injection in six doses to help with weight management, used together with healthy eating and increased physical activity.\nBagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, 17 February 2026\n\u2013 The European Commission has approved a new 7.2 mg once\u2011weekly maintenance dose of Wegovy\n\u00ae\n(semaglutide injection) for adults living with obesity. This gives doctors another option to help adults who need more weight loss after being on the 2.4 mg dose. The approval is based on a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency\u2019s scientific committee (CHMP) on 12 December 2025.\nThe approval means that doctors in the EU may now prescribe the 7.2 mg dosage as three 2.4 mg injections, to be taken in one sitting, still once a week. Novo Nordisk has applied for approval of a 7.2 mg single-dose pen in the EU, and if approved, it could be available this year. This means that in the European Union (EU), adults with obesity may now step directly from Wegovy\n\u00ae\n2.4 mg (for at least four weeks) up to 7.2 mg if they need greater weight loss while preserving muscle function.\nWegovy\n\u00ae\n7.2 mg is already approved and available in the UK, and regulatory applications are pending with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and several other countries.\nWhat did the study show?\nIn the two clinical studies, STEP UP (1,407 participants) and STEP UP T2D (512 participants), adults with obesity, without and with type 2 diabetes, respectively, who took the 7.2 mg dose once a week, plus lifestyle changes, lost considerably more weight than people on placebo.\nOn average, participants with obesity, without diabetes, taking Wegovy\n\u00ae\n7.2 mg had these results:\n21% body weight loss for those on Wegovy\n\u00ae\n7.2 mg when everyone took the medicine as planned, compared to about 2% weight loss for those taking placebo.\nAbout 1 in 3 people lost 25% or more of their body weight.\nBody composition improved with the majority (84%) of weight loss with Wegovy\n\u00ae\n7.2 mg coming from fat mass, with tests showing preserved muscle functioning.\nThe most common side effects were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting (24.8%) and dysaesthesia (22-9%). These events were usually mild to moderate and transient.\n\u201cThis approval is another important step in helping people living with obesity reach very significant weight loss,\u201d said Emil Kongsh\u00f8j Larsen, executive vice president, International Operations, Novo Nordisk. \u201cThe new dose gives healthcare professionals even more flexibility to tailor treatment and help people with obesity achieve their weight loss and health goals.\u201d\nWegovy\n\u00ae\ninjectable is now available in 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg, 2.4 mg and now 7.2 mg doses throughout the EU. Wegovy\n\u00ae\npill is available in the US and is pending approval in the EU.\nAbout Wegovy\n\u00ae\nInjectable semaglutide 2.4 mg is marketed under the brand name Wegovy\n\u00ae\n. In the EU, Wegovy\n\u00ae\nis indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight loss and weight maintenance in adults with an initial BMI of 30 kg/m\n2\nor greater (obesity) or adults with a BMI of 27 kg/m\n2\nor greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition.\u00a0In the EU, Wegovy\n\u00ae\nis also indicated for paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with an initial BMI at or above the 95\nth\npercentile for age and gender (obesity) and body weight above 60 kg. The clinical section of the label also includes data on Wegovy\n\u00ae\nmajor adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) risk reduction, improvements in HFpEF-related (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) symptoms and physical function, as well as pain reduction related to knee osteoarthritis.\nNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark.

    "full_text": "Hims & Hers unlawfully mass markets unapproved versions of Novo Nordisk\u2019s FDA-approved semaglutide medicines, deceiving patients and putting their health at risk\nNovo Nordisk takes decisive legal action to stop Hims\u2019 illegal conduct, protect public health, and defend the scientific innovations that deliver better health outcomes to Americans living with serious chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes\nNovo Nordisk is asking the court to permanently ban Hims from selling unapproved, compounded drugs that infringe our patents, and is seeking to recover damages\nPlainsboro,\u00a0NJ, US and Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, February 9, 2026\n\u2013 Novo Nordisk announced today that it has filed a lawsuit against telehealth company Hims & Hers (\u201cHims\u201d), for infringing US Patent 8,129,343 with Hims\u2019 compounded semaglutide products for the US market. Hims has engaged in promotional campaigns that highlight its compounded semaglutide products, duping consumers and healthcare professionals as to the clinical benefits and safety of these unapproved drugs. This includes Hims\u2019 recent launch, and two days later, abrupt discontinuance of its \u201cCompounded GLP-1 Pill,\u201d which came on the heels of Novo Nordisk\u2019s introduction of the Wegovy\n\u00ae\npill, the first and only FDA-approved GLP-1 pill for weight loss. Hims continues to unlawfully mass compound injectable versions, made with inauthentic API, and these knock-offs are putting patient health and wellbeing at risk.\n\u201cThroughout Novo Nordisk\u2019s 103-year-long history, patient safety has always been our top priority. Hims & Hers is mass marketing unapproved knock-off versions of Wegovy\n\u00ae\nand Ozempic\n\u00ae\nthat evade the FDA\u2019s gold standard review process \u2013 that\u2019s dangerous and deceptive to patients, and undermines the scientific innovation and regulatory rigor in place to ensure these treatments are safe and effective,\u201d said John F. Kuckelman, senior vice president, Group General Counsel, Global Legal, IP and Security. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken legal action to protect the American public and our intellectual property and will continue to work with regulators, law enforcement, and other key stakeholders to ensure patients have access to FDA approved safe and effective medicines.\u201d\nMass marketing by Hims and compounding pharmacies has flooded the market with knock-off Wegovy\n\u00ae\nand Ozempic\n\u00ae\n. Compounded semaglutide products may contain dangerous impurities or incorrect amounts of active ingredients, which can result in life-threatening immune responses, hospitalization, severe drug-drug interactions, and overdoses. According to Novo Nordisk\u2019s testing, injectable semaglutide drugs compounded by pharmacies were found to contain impurities of up to 86%, with compounded oral semaglutide drugs containing impurities as high as 75%. Even in small quantities, such impurities can negatively impact the safety and efficacy of a drug product, including unwanted immune responses like anaphylactic shock.\nAs the FDA\nexplained just last Friday\n, compounded GLP-1 drugs mass-marketed by Hims and other compounding pharmacies are \u201cdrugs for which the FDA cannot verify quality, safety, or efficacy.\u201d Respected organizations and experts in the medical community, such as the American Medical Association, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), and the Endocrine Society, have voiced similar concerns about knock-off GLP-1 drugs and the risk they pose to patients. The ADA recommends against using these\u00a0knock-offs\u00a0due to uncertainty about their content, safety, quality, and effectiveness.\nToday\u2019s action builds on Novo Nordisk\u2019s multi-year efforts to safeguard patients from unsafe compounded products, including other legal actions and educational campaigns like\n\"Check Before You Inject\"\nand\n\"Choose The Real Thing\"\naimed at raising awareness about the risks of unapproved knock-off drugs made with foreign inauthentic active pharmaceutical ingredients that can pose significant risks to patient safety. For more information about these efforts to protect patients, visit\nsemaglutide.com\n.\nNovo Nordisk is also making it easier for people in the US to get authentic, FDA-approved Wegovy\n\u00ae\n(pill and injection) and Ozempic\n\u00ae\nin the way that best fits their lives. With the supply of all doses of these medicines\u00a0fully available nationwide in the US, there is no reason for patients to gamble with their health with knock-off products.\nAbout Novo Nordisk\nNovo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company with a heritage of more than 100\u00a0years in diabetes care.
